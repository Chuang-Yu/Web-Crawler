We in China firmly support Germany in fighting the epidemic and are willing to continue providing any assistance we can. Experts from the two countries have conducted video exchanges, and German experts have also visited China with the WHO expert team.

The Chinese people sincerely hope that the United States will manage to control the spread of the epidemic as soon as possible and reduce the losses it inflicts on the American people. China has always taken a positive attitude toward international cooperation in prevention and control. Under the current circumstances, China and the United States should work together against this epidemic. The health departments and prevention and control experts of China and the United States have maintained communication on the international epidemic situation and on Sino-US cooperation in prevention and control. China is willing to continue sharing information and experiences with the United States without reservations. Some Chinese provinces, cities, and enterprises are providing medical supplies to the US. China understands the difficulties of the current situation in the United States and is willing to provide any support it can offer.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Phone call with US President Donald Trump, March 27, 2020\\n\\n\\tAfter the COVID-19 epidemic occurred in China, you expressed your sympathy and support to me at the earliest possible opportunity. The Saudi government and Saudi people from all walks of life have extended a helping hand and provided much material assistance to China. China shall not forget this.

China firmly supports Saudi Arabiaâ\\x80\\x99s fight against the epidemic and is willing to provide any assistance it can, sharing its prevention and control experiences with Saudi Arabia and providing assistance for and facilitating Saudi Arabiaâ\\x80\\x99s purchases of medical supplies, in the hope of safeguarding the health and safety of the people of our two countries and jointly maintaining the security of global and regional public health.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Phone call with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, March 27, 2020\\n\\n\\tAt the most difficult moment in Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s prevention and control of the epidemic, African countries have provided a great deal of valuable support to China, and this has imprinted itself in our minds. I am very concerned about the current epidemic situation in Africa. China has overcome difficulties and actively provided material assistance to the African Union and African countries to combat the epidemic, and organized an expert video conference to share experiences, while Chinese companies and non-governmental organizations have also offered assistance to African countries. These are all true representations of the community with a shared future that has been formed between China and Africa. We will continue to intensify our efforts to provide assistance in combating the epidemic to Namibia and other African countries, share prevention and control experiences, strengthen cooperation in the health domain, and work with you to achieve final victory in the fight against the epidemic. We are confident that, by jointly fighting against this epidemic, our friendship with Namibia and other African countries will be further deepened.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Phone call with President of Namibia Hage Geingob, April 3, 2020\\n\\n\\tIV. Public health security is a common challenge faced by humanity, and major infectious diseases are the enemy of all of us. Countries need to work together to comprehensively strengthen international cooperation and to bring together a powerful joint force to overcome the pandemic.\\n\\n\\tThe World Health Organization plays an important role in coordinating global health affairs. China attaches great importance to cooperating with the World Health Organization, and welcomes its participation in the prevention and control of the epidemic. Experts from the World Health Organization have already conducted a field visit to Wuhan. China is willing to work with the World Health Organization and the international community to jointly safeguard regional and global public health security. I trust that the World Health Organization and the international community can make an objective, fair, sober, and rational assessment of the epidemic situation.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Remarks at a meeting with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, January 28, 2020\\n\\n\\tPublic health security is a common challenge facing humanity and requires countries to work together. At present, outbreaks of COVID-19 have occurred in many countries. It is necessary to strengthen communication and exchanges with the WHO and to cooperate with relevant countries, especially countries badly affected, in the areas of tracing the outbreakâ\\x80\\x99s origins and in medicines, vaccines, and testing. With ensuring national security as a precondition, we should share scientific research data and information, jointly study and put forward mitigation strategies, and contribute ingenuity and energy to the building of a global community with a shared future.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Speech â\\x80\\x9cProviding Strong Scientific and Technological Support for Winning the Battle of Epidemic Prevention and Control,â\\x80\\x9d March 2, 2020\\n\\n\\tThe last few weeks have seen outbreaks of the epidemic in many countries, and the situation calls for great concern. The international community should intensify its actions, carry out effective international cooperation in joint prevention and control, and bring together a powerful joint force to overcome the epidemic. China is willing to share its experience of prevention and control with relevant countries, conduct joint research and development of drugs and vaccines, and is providing what assistance it can to some countries where the virus is spreading. China supports the United Nations and WHO in mobilizing the international community to strengthen policy coordination, increase investment of resources, and especially help developing countries with weak public health systems to prepare for prevention and response. China has announced a donation of US$20 million to the WHO in order to support international action launched by the WHO to combat the epidemic.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Phone call with UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, March 12, 2020\\n\\n\\tWe must strengthen international cooperation on epidemic prevention and control and work closely with the World Health Organization. We need to step up analysis and forecasting of developments in the global pandemic situation, and improve prevention and control strategies and policy measures to deal with risks coming in from beyond our borders. We need to increase exchanges and cooperation with relevant countries in epidemic prevention and control, and continue to provide whatever assistance we can. It is necessary to strengthen guidance and support for epidemic prevention and control with regard to Chinese citizens abroad, do well in all aspects of work, and safeguard their health and safety.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Remarks at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, March 18, 2020\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tStaff loading a cargo plane with the medical aids provided by Russian government to China at the Zhukovsky International Airport near Moscow, Russia, February 8, 2020.\\xa0Xinhua / Sputnik\\n\\n\\tChina and France both shoulder the heavy responsibility of safeguarding the security of international and regional public health. Our two countries should earnestly cooperate in order to advance joint research projects, strengthen cooperation on health and quarantine issues at national borders, support the WHO in its work, jointly help African countries with epidemic prevention and control, and strive to build a global community for public health.\\n\\n\\tChina is willing to work with France to encourage relevant parties to strengthen coordination and cooperation under frameworks like the United Nations and the G20, to carry out joint prevention and control, to improve global health governance, to help developing countries and other countries in need to strengthen capacity building, and to counter the impact of the pandemic on the world economy, thus allowing the bright rays of cooperation to disperse the shadows of the pandemic.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, March 23, 2020\\n\\n\\tViruses know no borders or races, and we humankind can conquer them only if we work together. All countries should advance cooperation within the framework of the United Nations and the G20, strengthen information exchange and experience sharing, and enhance collaboration on scientific research. We should support the WHO so that it can play its proper role, and promote the improvement of global health governance. Countries should strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, stabilize markets, maintain growth, safeguard peopleâ\\x80\\x99s livelihoods, and ensure that global supply chains are open, stable, and secure. I have every confidence that after defeating the pandemic, the mutual understanding between China and the UK will be deepened, consensus between our two countries will be broader, and our cooperation will usher in greater prospects for the future.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Phone call with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, March 23, 2020\\n\\n\\tChina and Brazil are comprehensive strategic partners. The two sides should maintain our strategic resolve, support each otherâ\\x80\\x99s core interests and major concerns, speak to the international community in a voice of solidarity, and convey a positive message about working hand-in-hand in our response to the epidemic. At the same time, we should advance pragmatic cooperation in various fields, strengthen communication and collaboration within the multilateral framework of the G20 and BRICS countries, and jointly maintain and develop the China-Brazil comprehensive strategic partnership. I am confident that China and Brazil will be able to work together to overcome the epidemic and push our all-round cooperation to a higher level.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Phone call with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, March 24, 2020\\n\\n\\tMajor infectious diseases are the enemy of all humanity. As we speak, the COVID-19 outbreak is spreading worldwide, posing an enormous threat to the health and safety of the people and bringing a formidable challenge to global public health security. The situation is worrying. At such a moment, it is all the more important for the international community to strengthen confidence, act with unity, and work together in a collective response. We must step up international cooperation on all fronts and foster greater synergy so that humanity as one could win the battle against this major infectious disease.\\n\\n\\tFor that to happen, I would like to put forth four proposals.\\n\\n\\tFirst, we need to be resolute in fighting a global war against the COVID-19 pandemic. The community of nations must move swiftly to curtail the spread of the virus. In this regard, I propose that a G20 health ministersâ\\x80\\x99 meeting be convened as quickly as possible to strengthen information sharing, carry out cooperation on medicine and vaccine research and development and epidemic control, and cut off cross-border infections. G20 members need to jointly help developing countries with weak public health systems to enhance preparedness and response capacity. I propose a G20 COVID-19 assistance initiative for better information sharing and coordination of policies and actions with the support of the World Health Organization. Guided by the vision of a global community with a shared future, China is more than ready to share its successful practices, conduct joint research and development of medicines and vaccines, and provide any assistance it can to countries hit by the growing outbreak.\\n\\n\\tSecond, we need to effectively mount a collective response to the pandemic at the international level. This is a virus that respects no borders. The outbreak we are battling is our common enemy. All countries must work together to build the most tightly knit global network of prevention and control the world has ever seen. China has set up an online COVID-19 knowledge center which is open to all countries. It is imperative that countries pool their strengths and speed up research and development of drugs, vaccines, and testing capabilities in the hope of achieving early breakthroughs to the benefit of all humanity. Discussions are also needed regarding the establishment of regional emergency liaison mechanisms to enable quicker response to public health emergencies.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tLocal people greet members of the third Chinese medical team with an elbow bump instead of handshake as the medics arrive at the Malpensa Airport in Milan, Italy, March 25, 2020. The team of 14 medical experts, all selected by Fujian Provincial Health Commission, was organized by Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s National Health Commission. On the same flight, they took with them medical supplies donated by China including ventilators, medical monitors and masks.\\xa0Xinhua\\n\\n\\tThird, we need to actively support international organizations in playing their proper roles. China supports the WHO in leading the global efforts to develop science-based, appropriate prevention and control measures and minimize cross-border spread. I call on G20 members to enhance anti-epidemic information sharing with the support of the WHO and to promote comprehensive, systematic, and effective control and treatment protocols. The G20 platform for communication and coordination may be used to increase policy dialogue and exchange, and a high-level meeting on global public health security should be convened in due course. China will be happy to join other countries and scale up support for relevant international and regional organizations.\\n\\n\\tFourth, we need to enhance international macroeconomic policy coordination. The outbreak has disrupted production and demand across the globe. Countries need to leverage and coordinate their macro policies to counteract the negative impact and prevent the world economy from falling into recession. We need to implement strong and effective fiscal and monetary policies to keep our exchange rates basically stable. We need to better coordinate financial regulation to keep global financial markets stable. We need to jointly keep the global industrial and supply chains stable. What China will do in this regard is to increase its supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients, daily necessities, anti-epidemic supplies and other products to the international market. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s more, we also need to protect women, children, the elderly, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups, and provide for peopleâ\\x80\\x99s basic needs. China will continue to pursue a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy. We will remain committed to advancing reform and opening up, widening market access, improving the business environment, and expanding imports and outbound investment to contribute to a stable world economy.\\n\\n\\tI want to call on all G20 members to take collective actionsâ\\x80\\x94cutting tariffs, removing barriers, and facilitating the unfettered flow of trade. Together, we can send a strong message to the international community and bolster confidence for global economic recovery. The G20 needs to draw up an action plan and promptly set up communication mechanisms and institutional arrangements for anti-epidemic macro policy coordination.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Speech â\\x80\\x9cWorking Together to Defeat the COVID-19 Outbreak,â\\x80\\x9d at the Extraordinary G20 Virtual Leadersâ\\x80\\x99 Summit, March 26, 2020\\n\\n\\tNow is a crucial moment, a time for us to rise to the challenge and act with swiftness.

Cooperation between China and the United States is beneficial to both sides, while fighting is harmful to both. Cooperation is the only correct choice. I hope that the United States will take substantive actions to improve Sino-US relations. The two sides should make joint efforts to strengthen cooperation in areas such as combating the epidemic, and develop a relationship without conflict or confrontation that is based on mutual respect and mutually beneficial cooperation.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Phone call with US President Donald Trump, March 27, 2020\\n\\n\\tV. China has taken timely, decisive, and effective measures in the fight against the virus, and it has not only been responsible for the health of its own people, but also contributed to global public health. China has made tremendous sacrifices to fight the pandemic, a fact that has been recognized by the global community.\\n\\n\\tUnder the centralized, unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, thanks to the concerted efforts of all sides, prevention and control work is proceeding effectively and has earned approval from all sectors of society and the international community. During my meeting with the WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, he stated that the swift speed and large scale with which China acted have rarely been seen in the world, that this is a manifestation of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s institutional strength and something worthy of other countries learning from, and that he was confident the measures China has taken would bring the epidemic under effective control and eventually defeat it.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80ã\\x80\\x80â\\x80\\x94Remarks at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee regarding the response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic, February 3, 2020\\n\\n\\tChina not only safeguards the health and safety of the Chinese people, but also safeguards the health and safety of the people of the world.

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)\\n\\n\\tBEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday delivered a speech titled \"Working Together to Defeat the COVID-19 Outbreak\" at the Extraordinary G20 Leaders\\' Summit via video link in Beijing.\\n\\n\\tThe following is an English translation of the full text of the speech:\\n\\n\\tWorking Together to Defeat the COVID-19 Outbreak\\n\\n\\tRemarks by H.E. Xi Jinping\\n\\n\\tPresident of the People\\'s Republic of China\\n\\n\\tAt the Extraordinary G20 Leaders\\' Summit\\n\\n\\tBeijing, 26 March 2020\\n\\n\\tYour Majesty King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud,\\n\\n\\tDear Colleagues,\\n\\n\\tIt is good to join you. Let me begin by expressing my sincere appreciation to His Majesty King Salman and Saudi Arabia for having done tremendous work of communication and coordination to make this summit possible.\\n\\n\\tFacing the COVID-19 outbreak that caught us all by surprise, the Chinese government and Chinese people have been undaunted as we took on this formidable task. From day one of our fight against the outbreak, we have put people\\'s life and health first. We have acted according to the overall principle of shoring up confidence, strengthening unity, ensuring science-based control and treatment and imposing targeted measures. We have mobilized the whole nation, set up collective control and treatment mechanisms and acted with openness and transparency. What we fought was a people\\'s war against the outbreak. We have put up a strenuous struggle and made tremendous sacrifices. Now the situation in China is moving steadily in a positive direction. Life and work are quickly returning to normal. Yet, there is no way we will lower our guard or relax control.\\n\\n\\tAt the most difficult moment in our fight against the outbreak, China received assistance and help from a lot of members of the global community. Such expressions of friendship will always be remembered and cherished by the Chinese people.\\n\\n\\tMajor infectious disease is the enemy of all. As we speak, the COVID-19 outbreak is spreading worldwide, posing enormous threat to life and health and bringing formidable challenge to global public health security. The situation is disturbing and unsettling. At such a moment, it is imperative for the international community to strengthen confidence, act with unity and work together in a collective response. We must comprehensively step up international cooperation and foster greater synergy so that humanity as one could win the battle against such a major infectious disease.\\n\\n\\tFor that to happen, I would like to put forth four proposals.\\n\\n\\tFirst, we need to be resolute in fighting an all-out global war against the COVID-19 outbreak. The community of nations must move swiftly to stem the spread of the virus. In this regard, I propose that a G20 health ministers\\' meeting be convened as quick as possible to improve information sharing, strengthen cooperation on drugs, vaccines and epidemic control, and cut off cross-border infections. G20 members need to jointly help developing countries with weak public health systems enhance preparedness and response. I propose a G20 COVID-19 assistance initiative for better information sharing and policy and action coordination with the support of the World Health Organization. Guided by the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, China will be more than ready to share our good practices, conduct joint research and development of drugs and vaccines, and provide assistance where we can to countries hit by the growing outbreak.\\n\\n\\tSecond, we need to make a collective response for control and treatment at the international level. This is a virus that respects no borders. The outbreak we are battling is our common enemy. All must work together to build a strongest global network of control and treatment that the world has ever seen. China has set up its online COVID-19 knowledge center that is open to all countries. It is imperative that countries pool their strengths and speed up research and development of drugs, vaccines and testing capabilities in the hope to achieve early breakthrough to the benefit of all. Discussions are also needed regarding the establishment of regional emergency liaison mechanisms to enable quicker response to public health emergencies.\\n\\n\\tThird, we need to support international organizations in playing their active roles. China supports WHO in leading the global efforts to develop science-based and proper control and treatment and minimize cross-border spread. I call on G20 members to enhance anti-epidemic information sharing with the support of WHO and to promote control and treatment protocols that are comprehensive, systematic and effective. The G20 platform for communication and coordination may be used to increase policy dialogue and exchange, and a high-level meeting on international public health security may be convened in due course. For China, we will be happy to join other countries and scale up support for relevant international and regional organizations.\\n\\n\\tFourth, we need to enhance international macro-economic policy coordination. The outbreak has disrupted production and demand across the globe. Countries need to leverage and coordinate their macro policies to counteract the negative impact and prevent the world economy from falling into recession. We need to implement strong and effective fiscal and monetary policies to keep our exchange rates basically stable. We need to better coordinate financial regulation to keep global financial markets stable. We need to jointly keep the global industrial and supply chains stable. What China will do in this regard is to increase its supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients, daily necessities, and anti-epidemic and other supplies to the international market. What\\'s more, we also need to protect women, children, the elderly, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups, and provide for people\\'s basic needs. China will continue to pursue a proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy. We will continue to advance reform and opening-up, widen market access, improve the business environment, and expand imports and outbound investment to contribute to a stable world economy.\\n\\n\\tI want to call on all G20 members to take collective actions - cutting tariffs, removing barriers, and facilitating the unfettered flow of trade. Together, we can send a strong signal and restore confidence for global economic recovery. The G20 needs to draw up an action plan and promptly set up communication mechanisms and institutional arrangements for anti-epidemic macro policy coordination.\\n\\n\\tDear Colleagues,\\n\\n\\tNow is a crucial moment, a time for us to rise up to challenge and act with swiftness. I am convinced that through solidarity and mutual assistance, we will prevail over this outbreak and we all will embrace a brighter future for mankind!\\n\\n\\tThank you.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2020/0327/c90000-9673046.html'}\n",

      "20,{'發稿日': ['February19', '2020'], '新聞標題': 'A Decisive Stage for Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s Fight against COVID-19 Epidemic', '作者': \"People's Daily Online\", '新聞內文': \"The peopleâ\\x80\\x99s war against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic is entering a decisive stage in China. Under the strong leadership of the central government, the whole nation has devoted tremendous amounts of resources and efforts to this war. The prevention and control of the epidemic in Hubei, especially in such heavily-hit areas as Wuhan, has become a key campaign; and the measures taken by other Chinese regions will determine whether this war will turn to be a war of attrition or a protracted war. For now, a few questions remain for the international community concerned about how soon China will totally conquer the coronavirus: When will be the turning point of the epidemic? What new measurers and efforts have the Chinese government and people taken to fight against the epidemic and with what effects? What new progresses have been made by the Chinese medical community in epidemic control and treatment to COVID-19 patients? And what lessons can be learned by the international public health circles from this war against an epidemic of even greater impact than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003? This report gives latest answers to those questions from a special research team at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS).\\n\\n\\tThe reports concludes that at present, the COVID-19 epidemic manifests a trend of localized clusters of outbreak (especially in the City of Wuhan and some other areas in Hubei Province) but coming increasingly in check in other parts of China. The situation in Hubei, Wuhan and other regions is expected to be further improved with enhanced national strategy and measures. Nevertheless, the turning point of the epidemic will depend on the effectiveness of the current prevention and control measures, as well as cooperation of the general public. In the next week or two, China will be faced by new challenges as millions of people return to work in major cities after the Spring Festival. If the number of new infections can be kept low for two weeks, then we can say the turning point has come in China except for Hubei.\\n\\n\\tThis report points out that although there is still no direct cure for COVID-19, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s government branch in charge of epidemic prevention, medical institutions and medical researchers have joined hands in optimizing the epidemic control strategy and patient treatment plans. It proves increasingly effective to detecting, confirming, and treating infected people at the earliest time, as well as to rescuing severely ill patients and reducing mortality rates.\\n\\n\\tIt is also pointed out that Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s whole-of-government approach and efficient social mobilization system are the basic guarantee for victory of the peopleâ\\x80\\x99s war. The many unconventional measures adopted so far -- such as rushing medical staff and other resources to Wuhan from around China, assigning 19 provinces or municipalities to each help treat severely ill patients in a specified area in Hubei, instituting workfrom-home arrangements, and calling for the public to stay home unless necessary -- all will help China to win the war against the epidemic.\\n\\n\\tAs this report believes in the end, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s ongoing peopleâ\\x80\\x99s war against COVID19 epidemic can lend many lessons and inspirations to the international community for combating pandemics in the future. In the globalized era, the world is yet to be ready for pandemics breaking out in mega-cities. How to strengthen the response capabilities of local public health systems in face of an epidemic? How to gather and coordinate various resources of a nation for effective epidemic prevention and control? And how to enhance the sense of a community of shared future for mankind and reinforce joint efforts of the international community against a pandemic? The key to those questions lies in solidarity of the nation, scientific prevention and control measures, and strengthened international cooperation. I firmly believe this peopleâ\\x80\\x99s war against the epidemic will give much enlightenment to both China and the international community.\\n\\n\\tChina's Fight Against COVID-19 Epidemic: A Decisive Campaign\\n\\n\\tChina is arriving at a critical moment in the war against novel coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19). According to statistics, although the absolute number of confirmed diagnoses is still increasing, its growth rate has begun to show a downturn in China except for Wuhan and a few other areas in Hubei province. Through joint efforts of the whole nation, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s highest-level prevention and control measures have proven quite effective, with the spread of the virus slowing down and the diagnosis and cure rates on a steady rise. Thanks to timely adjustments of the national strategy and measures in epidemic control, the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on Wuhan, Hubei, and elsewhere in China has been increasingly contained: on one hand, the unceasing inflow of various national resources is ushering in a turning point in the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan and Hubei; on the other hand, imported infections and subsequent spread of the virus in other regions have been under ever tighter control as a result of strengthened measures targeted at the local situations.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tAt present, the Chinese government and society are sparing no effort to win the war against the epidemic: rushing medical staff and other resources to Wuhan from around China, assigning 19 provinces or municipalities to each help treat severely ill patients in a specified area in Hubei, legislating for scientific prevention and control of the epidemic by the Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s Congress in many places, instituting work-from-home arrangements, mustering intelligence support from internet companies, and calling for the public to stay home unless necessary. All these unconventional moves are helping China to win the race with time.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tChinaâ\\x80\\x99s Prevention and Control Measures Are Taking Effect\\n\\n\\tFirst, statistics have shown that the epidemic has been kept in check. Nationwide, except for Hubei province, the growth rates of confirmed infections, suspected cases, and patients under medical observation are all a steady decline. To be more specific, newly confirmed cases in places other than Hubei had decreased, for eight days in a row, from 890 on February 3 to 312 on February 12. On February 12, according to the fifth edition of Guidelines on Novel Coronavirus Diagnosis and Treatment, Hubei health authorities counted clinically diagnosed cases as confirmed, which resulted in a\\n\\n\\tsharp increase in new confirmed cases. This broadened diagnosis criteria further reflects Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s enhanced diagnostic capacity and the principle of â\\x80\\x9cleaving no one unattended or under-attended.â\\x80\\x9d (Figure 1)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tNationwide, the spread of the deadly virus has been effectively curbed. Although the adoption of a new diagnosis criteria resulted in a sharp increase in reported newinfections and death toll on February 12 alone, the growth rates of both categories were lower than those during the peak moment. The growth rate of confirmed cases decreased from 64.54% on January 27 to 33.93% on February 12; that of COVID-19- associated deaths decreased from the peak of 64% on January 24 to 22.82% on February 12. Moreover, suspected cases and patients under medical observation were also on the decline. Suspected cases registered a negative growth rate of -16.38% on February 12 compared with 173.77% on January 23, while the growth rate of patients under medical observation decreased from as high as 253.52% on January 22 to a negative rate of - 1.97% on February 12. (Figure 2)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tSecond, the epicenter of the epidemic has been confined to such areas as Wuhan, Xiaogan, and Huanggang in Hubei, while the confirmed cases in other regions in China are relatively few and mainly imported ones. On the whole, Hubei has witnessed the majority of confirmed cases, severe cases and COVID-19-associated deaths in China. As Figure 3 shows, between January 20 and February 12, COVID-19-associated deaths in Hubei were 95% of the national number (1,310 out of 1,368); severe cases in Hubei were 88% (7,084 out of 8,030); and confirmed cases in Hubei were 80% (48,206 out of 59,804). After the peak of imported cases, other regions in China have had no new outbreak thanks to the strong prevention and control measures nationwide.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tThird, the growth of severe cases around China is slowing down and the rehabilitation rate has surpassed the death rate. As a key indicator to the severity and fatality of the epidemic, severe cases have been under most meticulous treatment and with utmost care. As a result, the death rate had dropped from over 100% on January 20 to a negative rate of -2.17% on February 12.(Figure 4)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tFourth, the COVID-19-caused mortality rate is on a steady decline. As shown by the daily ratio between accumulated deaths and severe cases, the mortality rate has been decreasing significantly in Hubei (from 40% on January 25 to 18.49% on February 12) and remains low (well below 10%) in other regions of China (Figure 5).\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tFifth, with deeper understanding of the coronavirus and enhanced effectiveness of medical treatment, the number of cured patients has kept rising -- from 34 by January 23 to 5,911 by February 12 nationwide. Besides, the number of cured patients has begun to exceed that of COVID-19-caused deaths since February 1, with 24 more cured cases on February 1 to 4544 on February 12 (Figure 6). In Shandong, Zhejiang and a few\\xa0 other provinces, the number of cured patients has even begun to surpass that of confirmed cases.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tThe war against COVID-19 epidemic has come to a critical moment. Currently, there are two major views on when the turning point will be. Prudent optimists think that it will come sometime between February 10 to 15, right after Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s Lantern Festival. According to Professor Zhong Nanshan, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, director of the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, and head of the High-level Panel of Experts, the latent period of the novel coronavirus is usually 3 to 7 days and 24 days at maximum. With the nationwide restrictions on population flow, both the peak and turning point of the epidemic will appear around the Lantern Festival.2 On this trend, the epidemic may be over by the end of April.\\n\\n\\tPessimists, however, predict that the turning point will come as late as April, with confirmed cases surpassing 70,000. For instance, a research done by Professor Joseph T. Wuâ\\x80\\x99s team at the School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, Hong Kong University, published on The Lancet on January 31, forecast the turning point of the epidemic to appear in April based on latest mathematical modelling. Meanwhile, the research points out that â\\x80\\x9c[t]o possibly succeed, substantial, even draconian measures that limit population mobility should be seriously and immediately considered in affected areas, as should strategies to drastically reduce within-population contact rates through cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures, and instituting work-fromhome arrangements, for example.â\\x80\\x9dNow that all the recommended measures have been adopted, the gloomy forecast is not quite likely to become reality.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tIn fact, the turning point of the epidemic not only depends on the objective laws of the development of the novel coronavirus, but it is also a function of the collective efforts of the Chinese government and people. As Professor Chen Wei, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering and researcher at the Institute of Military Medical Sciences of the PLA Academy of Military Sciences, warns, although the turning point is coming soon, the possibility of recurring of the epidemic still remains, and thus it is necessary to plan for the worst and make fullest preparation for long-term fight against it. In the same vein, Mr. Zhang Wenhong, director of the Department for Infectious Diseases at Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University and a member of the Shanghai special medical team for COVID-19, calls for support from the general public, saying that â\\x80\\x9cstaying home and refraining from going out is also a contribution to our fight [against the epidemic].\\n\\n\\tTherefore, it is believed that despite the positive progresses in prevention and control of the novel coronavirus, the turning point of the epidemic will be determined by further endeavor of the Chinese government and people. China is facing new challenges especially in the next one to two weeks, as millions of people from all over the country are returning to work in mega-cities after the Spring Festival. If the number of new infections remains low two weeks later, it can be said that the turning point has come except for Hubei.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tIn general, strong epidemic control, effective medical treatment to COVID-19 patients, and enhancing rehabilitation rate are three interrelated key missions of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s war against the epidemic. Only when all of them are achieved, can China win the war in the shortest time.\\n\\n\\tAbove all, a decrease of new confirmed and suspected cases will be the most direct indicator of the turning point and a clear proof of the effectiveness of the prevention and control measures. At present, despite the increase of the absolute number of new confirmed and suspected cases, its growth rate has been on the decline for days. If such trend continues for another week or two, then the first mission will be accomplished.\\n\\n\\tNext, as the biggest threat to public health, severe cases and COVID-19-caused deaths are the main roots of public fear of the epidemic. A decreasing number of severe cases and deaths will indicate that the medical treatment is taking effect and that the severity of the epidemic is in check. Up to now, the mortality rate of COVID-19 has remained rather low except in Hubei, which means the epidemic has been under tight control in most Chinese regions. After classified treatment and a greater number of intensive care unit (ICU) facilities are introduced in Hubei, the mortality rate there is expected to shrink as well.\\n\\n\\tFinally, the ultimate victory will be achieved when all COVID-19 patients are cured. Now, the rehabilitation rate is increasing steadily with enhanced measures and capabilities of medical treatment, while the public has developed more understanding about COVID-19 and strengthened self-protection. Both will help reduce the number of new cases and augment the rehabilitation rate.\\n\\n\\tOptimizing Epidemic Prevention and Control Strategies and Medical Treatment Guidelines\\n\\n\\tAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no direct cure or treatment for COVID-19. Thus, early detection, quarantine and treatment remain the most effective method to contain the coronavirus. The National Health Commission (NHC) has classified COVID-19 as a Category B disease requiring Category A measures in accordance with Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases. Supported by the government and in partnership with their international counterparts, Chinese medical institutions have taken relentless efforts to improve medical treatment of patients and made remarkable achievements. So far, the NHC has released Guidelines for COVID-19 Prevention and Control and Guidelines for COVID-19 Treatment and is updating them according to latest developments. The Ministry of Science and Technology, NHC, and National Medical Products Administration are also supporting research institutions and pharmaceutical companies in their efforts to screen and evaluate the most efficient drugs from all available or under-development medicines. Moreover, the central leading group on COVID-19 prevention and control is organizing resources of all levels to minimize the epidemicâ\\x80\\x99s impact on psychological well-being of eligible people.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tAdapting Prevention and Control Strategies to Latest Developments\\n\\n\\tBased on existing knowledge of the novel coronavirus, the 4th edition of the Guidelines for COVID-19 Prevention and Control emphasizes the importance of effective mobilization and timely coordination among all medical institutions and underscores the imperative of adherence to the principles of â\\x80\\x9cearly detection, early reporting, early diagnosis, early quarantine, and early treatment.â\\x80\\x9d Besides, it has updated the monitoring methods, epidemiological survey tactics, and restrictive measures regarding close contacts and asymptomatic infections. For example, it specifies how to detect asymptomatic infections and outlines the requirements that have to be met before those asymptomatic patients can be discharged from medical observation; meanwhile, concentrated quarantine is requested for close contacts in regions with adequate resources.\\n\\n\\tEnhancing Capacity of Pathogen Detection and Clinical Diagnosis , Choosing Treatment Sites According to Patientsâ\\x80\\x99Conditions\\n\\n\\tEffective quarantine is most important for epidemic containment; and the improvement of detection diagnosis rates is key to patient identification. 2019-nCoV cases are mainly confirmed through nucleic acid tests. At the early stage of the epidemic, large numbers of infections were left unconfirmed and unreported due to deficiencies in testing methods, equipment, and techniques. As Wang Chen, a pulmonologist at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said on February 4, â\\x80\\x9cthe two crucial issues in the current fight against the virus are improving the detection and diagnosis rates by increasing the amount of nucleic acid testing; and gathering all confirmed cases with mild symptoms for quarantine to prevent wider spread.â\\x80\\x9d At present, 40 testing institutions in Wuhan have been authorized to conduct testing of up to 10,000 persons per day. As our understanding of and clinical experience in treating the disease grow, the NHC has released the fifth edition of Guidelines on Novel Coronavirus Diagnosis and Treatment in which the category of clinical diagnosis is added to give confirmed cases the earliest possible standard treatment and improve the cure rates.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tIn Relentless Search of Effective Medicines and Treatment Options\\n\\n\\tMedical research institutions and pharmaceutical companies around the world have been engaged in the endeavor to find the most effective treatment and drugs. As of February 6, there had been 36 clinical trials related to the novel coronavirus registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, covering a wide range of research domains, including Western medicine clinical research, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment, traditional Chinese-Western hybrid treatment, psychotherapy, and postrecovery rehabilitation. Approved by the National Medical Products Administration, a medical task force led by Wang Chen and Cao Bin of China-Japan Friendship Hospital launched Phase III of Remdesivir Clinical Trial on February 5. At the same time, Chinese experts have identified a number of Western and Chinese-patent drugs as potentially effective in containing the virus, such as Chloroquine, Arbidol, Darunavir, and Favipiravir; related animal tests and clinical trials are being conducted.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tExploring TCMâ\\x80\\x99s Unique Advantages\\n\\n\\tApart from Western medicine and medical treatment, medical institutions in China are also exploring what role TCM can play in the fight against the virus. Eight patients, including six severe cases, were cured and discharged from Jin Yin Tan Hospital in Wuhan on February 3 after receiving TCM and traditional Chinese-Western hybrid treatment by experts from Guangâ\\x80\\x99anmen Hospital and Xiyuan Hospital, two preeminent hospitals affiliated to the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. As Dr, Li Guangxi, dean of the Department for Respiratory Diseases at Guangâ\\x80\\x99anmen Hospital, put it, traditional Chinese medicine has accumulated many best practices in fighting off infectious diseases and is now demonstrating its unique advantages in combat with the novel coronavirus. Thus, the 5th edition of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s Guidelines for COVID-19 Treatment advises medical institutions to â\\x80\\x9cgive full play to TCM treatment, enhance traditional\\xa0Chinese-Western hybrid approaches, and set up joint traditional Chinese-Western diagnosis and treatment mechanisms......to find out the treatment scheme most suitable to the actual conditions of patients and local weather conditions.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\tProviding Timely Support for Psychological Well-being of the Public\\n\\n\\tPsychological crisis intervention is also included as part of the effort to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the psychological well-being of eligible people. To this end, two documents, Guiding Principles for Emergent COVID-19-Caused Psychological Crisis Intervention and Guidelines for Psychological Aid Hotline during COVID-19 Outbreak, have been released. Various free hotlines have been set up to provide a wide range of services (such as counselling, psychotherapy, and crisis intervention) to comfort and help those in distress or mental disorder caused by COVID-19.\\n\\n\\tFull Governmental and Social Mobilization in China\\n\\n\\tA Race with Time\\n\\n\\tTime holds the key in the current war against COVID-19 epidemic; and victory depends on how much faster nationwide mobilization for assistance to Wuhan and Hubei comes before the spread of the deadly virus. Among the 9 million residents in locked-down Wuhan are those already under medical treatment and infected people who carry the virus in latency. Whether these asymptomatic carriers can be put under proper treatment in the fastest possible way is another key factor, as long delay may lead to family and community transmission on a much larger scale. Therefore, the central government is mobilizing and coordinating steady supplies of medical equipment and materials for Wuhan and Hubei, the front-line areas where tailored and targeted measures have already been adopted to build up local capacity in patient admission and treatment.\\n\\n\\tFirst, a precisely tailored system has been established to leave no patient unattended or under-attended. Severe patients are treated in designated hospitals, while patients with mild symptoms are sent to other specified institutions. Suspected cases with fever will remain in fever clinics under medical observation. Patients with CT-confirmed lung inflammatory signs are gathered in institutions isolated from suspected cases to prevent cross infection. Close contacts with confirmed cases are monitored in either collective or at-home quarantine.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tSecond, a three-level quarantine model has been put in place to improve medical resource allocation. The two new hospitals, Leishenshan and Huoshenshan, and other remodeled institutions have added 8,000 beds for severe patients in Wuhan and more than 10,000 beds are expected to be ready for use as more institutions are modified to admit patients. Three makeshift hospitals known as â\\x80\\x9csquare cabinâ\\x80\\x9d hospitals have been erected in Wuhan to provide 4,400 beds for patients with mild symptoms; and altogether more than 10 such hospitals will be ready for use soon. Hotels near hospitals have be temporarily turned into places for quarantine for potential virus carriers. So far, Wuhan has had 132 such facilities with 12,571 beds. This three-tiered quarantine model allowspatients in different conditions to receive the most appropriate treatment, which helps optimize the allocation of medical resources.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tThird, the central government is mobilizing more resources from all over China to reinforce Wuhan in the war against COVID-19 epidemic. To â\\x80\\x9cleave no patient unattended or under-attendedâ\\x80\\x9d requires a continuous inflow of medical workers and materials. Thus, the central government has made it clear that â\\x80\\x9csteady supply of materials for epidemic control in Hubei province, especially in Wuhan, is the top priority for the nation. The central government is in charge of coordinating provision of materials in short supply. Hubei must do its best in material management and allocationâ\\x80\\x9d; and that â\\x80\\x9cmore medical experts specializing in respiratory diseases, intensive care, and nursing will be sent to assist Hubei.â\\x80\\x9d As of February 5, 107 medical teams of 10,596 professionals had been sent to Hubei, most of them working in Wuhan. Moreover, 19 provinces and municipalities have been assigned to each help treat severely ill patients in a specified area in Hubei.\\n\\n\\tTop Priority of the Nation\\n\\n\\tAt present, local governments around China are shifting their focus from curbing Wuhan-exported cases to cutting off sources of potential family and community transmission. More vigorous measures are taken and best practices widely shared. For example, successful models of social governance in some cities are being replicated nationwide, such as setting up quarantine sites, building â\\x80\\x9csquare cabinâ\\x80\\x9d hospitals, canceling social gatherings, and shutting down venues for public events. Population mobility is restricted to the minimum level and local residents are advised to stay at home.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tAt the same time, public awareness of health and personal hygiene has been raised considerably in health education campaigns nationwide. The public is eager to learnanything about epidemic prevention and has begun to improve their diets and living habits. Health tips about respiratory diseases are perhaps the most popularized knowledge right now: for example, respiratory diseases are spread through contact, droplets and air; main symptoms include fever, cough, and diarrhoea; and wearing masks, washing hands often, using disinfectant, and sufficient ventilation can help protect against the diseases. As people come to realize that wild animals are the most likely hosts of coronavirus, many are calling for the government to totally ban the consumption and trade of wild animals.\\n\\n\\tTo guarantee timely and effective measures in the war against COVID-19 epidemic, local authorities are clarifying the respective powers, rights and obligations of the government, enterprises, and individuals by emergency legislation. For example, the standing committee of the Shanghai Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s Congress has passed legislation authorizing the Shanghai municipal government to blacklist those who attempt to conceal their health conditions in the social credit system.\\n\\n\\tGreat Contribution of Internet companies\\n\\n\\tChinese tech giants are exploring how emerging technologies can be applied to help fight against the coronavirus. Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, ZTE, iFLYTEK, and JD.com are all actively employing such technologies as big data, artificial intelligence, as well as 5G in long-distance diagnosis, screening, and medical services. Long-distance diagnosis services are used to reduce the likelihood of infection during hospital visits. Up to now, ZTE has launched a 5G long-distance diagnosis platform linking West China Hospital and the Chengdu Public Health Clinic Center; Tecent, Alibaba Health, and Ping An Health Cloud Company have also begun to offer online medical consultation services to reduce unnecessary hospital visits and prevent cross infection.\\n\\n\\tBig data analysis helps screening in public places. Megvii and Baidu have installed infrared sensors in some sections of Beijing Metro system to take passengersâ\\x80\\x99 body temperature, improving the efficiency of suspected case identification in crowded public places.\\n\\n\\tAI algorithm helps confirm suspected cases much faster. Baidu has made its DNA sequencing algorithm and RNA structure prediction website available to medical research institutions. A whole-genome testing and analyzing platform -- jointly developed by the Zhejiang Provincial CDC, Alibaba DAMO Academy, and MATRIDX -- has considerably improved the speed and accuracy of confirmation of suspected cases.\\n\\n\\tIn addition, AI technology has been widely applied to ensure medical supplies. For example, iFLYTEK has opened up its â\\x80\\x9cAI+Officeâ\\x80\\x9d platform to offer high-quality telecommuting services for enterprises and individuals. Zuoyebang.com provides longdistance education services. CloudMinds offers a number of multi-purpose robots to deliver goods and services in quarantine areas and to disinfect and clean wards.\\n\\n\\tLessons Learned\\n\\n\\tAlthough the COVID-19 epidemic continues, China is well-positioned to win the ultimate victory against it. This monumental event offers China and the world a number of important lessons regarding international cooperation on global public health emergencies.\\n\\n\\tFirst, a globalized world featuring more densely-populated metropolitan areas with higher population mobility poses unique challenges for epidemic prevention and control. Although mega-cities have generally established full-fledged public health emergency response mechanisms, yet economic, political, social, and security concerns all magnify decision-makersâ\\x80\\x99 and the publicâ\\x80\\x99s sensitivity to the outbreak of infectious diseases. Therefore, emergency response mechanisms, social mobilization systems, andreserve systems for strategic assets must be institutionalized in mega-cities. Besides, the competence of community-level officials and individualsâ\\x80\\x99 public health awareness need to be improved through more training courses and mass education programs.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tSecond, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s cross-region medical supply systems and coordinating networks for medical experts are playing a decisive role in the current war against COVID-19 epidemic. Rallying more than 10,000 medical professionals and coordinating huge amounts of medical materials to reinforce Wuhanâ\\x80\\x99s public health systems at short notice is not only a result of the full functioning of the central and local governments, but also thanks to efficient logistics and professional/resource allocation. For sure, China can share its challenges and good practices with the international community.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tLast but not least, international cooperation proves increasingly important in the war against COVID-19 epidemic. In partnership with China, the WHO has been closely monitoring the epidemic and coordinating a concerted international response. National governments across the world have also extended a helping hand. As of February 7, more than 30 countries, including developing countries with medical supply shortages like Pakistan and Myanmar, have donated medical materials to China. Such acts of international humanitarianism indicate that in times of global emergency, international solidarity and coordination, rather than extreme rhetoric and excessive reaction, is what is needed for the well-being of the international community. For, as the Chinese saying goes, â\\x80\\x9cSaving him to whom youâ\\x80\\x99re tied from the river is saving yourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\tSource: Shanghai Institutes for International Studies\", '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2020/0219/c90000-9659480.html'}\n"

Photo: Xinhua\\n\\n\\tThe novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, Central China\\'s Hubei Province, has become the focus of international attention. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared on January 30 the epidemic public health emergency of international concern. Over the past few days, leaders of various countries and heads of many international organizations have shown their sympathy and support for China\\'s fight against the epidemic and have generously provided aid such as much-needed medical supplies.\\n\\n\\tHowever, senior officials and media outlets of some Western countries have ignored China\\'s enormous efforts to combat the epidemic and launched attacks against the country. Their acts disregard the facts and are extremely immoral, just as a Chinese proverb describes - dropping stones on someone who has fallen into a well.\\n\\n\\tMajor disasters are the severest test of human nature. Human rights violations against Chinese, even Asian-looking people, such as racial discrimination and border entry rejection, deserve the vigilance of the international community.\\n\\n\\tInfectious diseases, which may break out in any region of any nation, are humanity\\'s formidable enemy. Folke Henschen, the author of The History and Geography of Disease, once said, \"human history is also the history of diseases.\" In human history, smallpox, plague, cholera, leprosy, tuberculosis, measles, rabies, malaria, yellow fever and other infectious diseases have all posed great threats to humans.\\n\\n\\tThe Plague of Athens (430BC-427BC) devastated the ambitious city-state of Athens. The Antonine Plague (165AD-180AD) killed almost one-third of the Roman Empire\\'s population. The Black Death that erupted in 1347 swept across Europe, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 25-30 million people. Before it was eradicated, smallpox plagued humanity for at least 3,000 years. In the 18th century, the number of Europeans who died of smallpox was estimated at over 150 million. And in the 20th century alone, smallpox took the lives of more than 300 million people.\\n\\n\\tThe death toll of the 1918 influenza pandemic is estimated to have reached 50 million, while World War I resulted in the deaths of about 40 million. The outbreak of Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 in Mexico and the US in March 2009 lasted for more than a year, affecting 214 countries and regions and resulting in approximately 284,500 deaths. In 2014, the Ebola virus disease spread to multiple countries in just a few months, killing more than 7,000 people in West Africa. Infectious diseases have killed more people than wars and natural disasters.\\n\\n\\tTo combat infectious diseases, humanity has continued to improve medical technology and public sanitation, which has ensured health security and promoted scientific and technological progress. In this sense, fighting diseases, especially infectious diseases, is one of the driving forces in the development of human civilization. Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found as early as the late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century.\\n\\n\\tAt the end of the 18th century, British doctor Edward Jenner created and promoted the smallpox vaccine, which greatly curbed the possible outbreak of the variola virus and reduced the death rate. In 1928, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a powerful antibacterial drug, ending the era when infectious diseases were incurable. In 1972, Chinese scientist Tu Youyou successfully extracted artemisinin for the treatment of malaria, which has saved millions of lives worldwide, especially in developing countries. Tu was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2015.\\n\\n\\tSince the 18th century, some European countries have taken the lead in the construction of urban sanitation facilities, improving water and sewage systems as well as centralizing waste treatment and disinfection. All these measures have effectively prevented infectious diseases such as the plague. In modern times, the concerted efforts of the international community have eradicated some once rampant infectious diseases. For example, the World Health Organization announced in December 1979 that the world was free of variola virus.\\n\\n\\tThe ongoing epidemic of the novel coronavirus-related peneumonia is another example of infectious diseases that has alarmed humanity. Faced with this major public health emergency, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has been leading the Chinese people in the war to prevent and control the spread of the epidemic. The CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core attaches great importance to the prevention and control of the epidemic, and to the interests of the people. It has set up a leading group responding to the pneumonia outbreak, and established an all-around and multi-level epidemic prevention and control system. All relevant measures are being carried out in an orderly and effective manner.\\n\\n\\tA level I emergency response that includes swift measures has been activated in 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China. Each authority has spared no effort to allocate medical resources in line with the policy of \"collecting patients, assembling experts, centralizing resources and focusing on treatment.\" The country has dispatched working groups to guide local authorities in terms of improving diagnosis, treatment, emergency monitoring, epidemiologic investigation and sampling and testing.\\n\\n\\tThousands of medical staff have been storming into Wuhan to help. Factory employees have worked around the clock to produce medical supplies such as masks and protective outfits. The authoritative information on epidemic prevention and control has been released in a timely manner, and the interpretation of relevant policies and measures have been strengthened.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tMedical workers pose for a photo at Huoshenshan (Fire God Mountain) Hospital in Wuhan, central China\\'s Hubei Province, Feb. 4, 2020. (Photo by Fan Xianhai/Xinhua)\\n\\n\\tChina is also raising the public\\'s awareness of the disease and people\\'s ability to protect themselves from being infected. Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital were built within days. Green channels have been opened by customs across China to ensure the speedy entry of materials for epidemic prevention and control. Civilian charter flights have brought stranded overseas Chinese citizens home. The Chinese government has promised to cover the medical expenses of patients infected by the virus. Chinese people from all walks of life are donating money and materials to fight the epidemic.\\n\\n\\tWhen the outbreak was first discovered, China did its utmost to implement epidemic prevention, control and rescue measures, maximizing the protection of people\\'s lives and health. China also notified the WHO and relevant countries in a timely manner, proactively promoted international cooperation, and adopted measures to reduce the spread of the epidemic beyond its border. The country treated foreigners in China with kindness, demonstrating its responsibility.\\n\\n\\tChina\\'s determination, measures and effectiveness have been a proactive response to the epidemic, and have been universally respected by the international community. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on January 30 praised the Chinese government for the extraordinary measures it has taken to curb the spread of the coronavirus, saying that \"China deserves our gratitude and respect.\" He said, \"We would have seen many more cases outside China by now - and probably deaths - if it were not for the government\\'s efforts and the progress they have made to protect their own people and the people of the world.\"\\n\\n\\tThe WHO has confidence in China\\'s ability to control the outbreak, and has not recommended any travel or trade restriction in response to the epidemic. Many countries, such as Germany, France, the UK, Russia, Thailand, Nepal, Tunisia, Cambodia, North Korea, and Cuba, and international organizations, including the European Union, the World Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, have shown their appreciation and support of China\\'s efforts in preventing and controlling the novel coronavirus.\\n\\n\\tRussian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday praised China\\'s moves to fight the virus, saying, \"The Chinese authorities are taking decisive and vigorous measures in order to stop the epidemic.\" Jiji Press, a news agency in Japan, said that combating the virus is not a matter only for China. Silk Road Today, a media outlet in Kazakhstan, said that China\\'s measures implemented to fight the virus are protecting not only China, but also the rest of world.\\n\\n\\tHowever, there are still a few countries taking unfriendly measures toward China. A foreign media outlet even insulted the Chinese national flag on the pretext of the pneumonia. Overreaction toward Chinese citizens has also been witnessed abroad. Anyone in any country may be the victim of the epidemic, regardless of race or nationality. Anyone holding a rational, objective and fair stance will fully approve and respect the unremitting efforts made by the Chinese government and people to combat the epidemic, and will be deeply sympathetic to and firmly support the Chinese people.\\n\\n\\tIn the face of the severe situation, the Chinese government has always prioritized its people\\'s safety and health. China understands some countries\\' concerns about the virus, but the international community should fully trust the Chinese government\\'s ability to deal with emergencies. China\\'s efforts in preventing and controlling the coronavirus have produced effective results. With the continuous enrichment of local healthcare resources and optimization of medical plans, the number of newly cured patients being discharged from hospitals has been rising every day. Chinese people are united in this fight to end the epidemic, and are sparing no effort to save lives. China will eventually win the battle against the disease, just as it defeated SARS 17 years ago.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tThe author is executive director and professor at the Human Rights Studies Center, Central South University.

      "31,{'發稿日': ['February07', '2020'], '新聞標題': \"Morbid views on China won't cure coronavirus patients\", '作者': 'CNTV', '新聞內文': 'Screenshoot via Wall Street Journal website\\n\\n\\tThe U.S. political scientist Walter Russell Mead recently wrote an article infamously titled \"China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia\" related to China\\'s role in the ongoing novel coronavirus. It is ridiculous to have this kind of thought in the 21st century, let alone by a well-known political scientist of the world\\'s most powerful nation.\\n\\n\\tChinese President Xi Jinping pointed out on March 23, 2013, in a speech in Moscow State Institute of International Relations that the West needs to keep pace with the times that the tide of history is unstoppable. \"We cannot have ourselves physically living in the 21st century, but with a mindset belonging to the past, stalled in the old days of colonialism, and constrained by zero-sum Cold War mentality.\"\\n\\n\\t\"Sick Man of East Asia\" originally referred to China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when imperialist China implemented a closed-door policy that led to years of isolation and internal turmoil, and the foreign powers took the advantage to force China to signing many unequal treaties.\\n\\n\\tToday, China has implemented reforms and opening-up policies for more than four decades. With strong and effective leadership, not just the economy is growing rapidly, the Chinese people are also living more confidently than ever before. To label China as \"the Sick Man of Asia\" again in the 21st century is just outdated.\\n\\n\\tSpeaking of the coronavirus epidemic that broke out in Wuhan, many criticize Chinese authorities\\' response for being too slow. Because it is a new type of coronavirus that no one has met before, time was needed to understand and discover the origin of the virus, so that then physicians could make medication to cure it. Besides, the spread of the virus coincided with the travel season of the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays in which many people return to their loved ones in planes or high-speed trains, so the authorities also needed time to roll out policies to temporally stop all public transport in order to quarantine as many as possible.\\n\\n\\tIt wouldn\\'t be easy for any country with a large population of 1.4 billion people, but when the policies rolled out, literally all people from metropolitan areas to city dwellers, from townsmen to the villagers started staying at home and wearing masks.\\n\\n\\tTo blame one country for lagging when it comes to dealing with the epidemic is irresponsible not only for the well-being of the Chinese people but also for other countries\\' citizens as well.\\n\\n\\tIn a blog post \"Bugs don\\'t recognize nationality,\" two famous American public health advocates Chelsea Clinton and Devi Sridhar said in 2017, \"regardless of individual or even national views on the larger debate of insularity or openness, consensus exists â\\x80\\x93 or at least could emerge â\\x80\\x93 that cooperation is necessary for global health.\"\\n\\n\\tFrom the beginning of the outbreak, the Chinese government has been very cooperative with experts around the world. With data from China, the World Health Organization set up a free online course for the public to get to know the epidemic better and to set up preventing precautions for themselves only in a week. Chinese pharmaceutical researchers also cooperated with world counterparts, including many from America.\\n\\n\\tMoreover, many Chinese people overseas voluntarily purchased a large number of masks and other medical equipment from the countries where they live now and sent them to the land where their ancestors once lived to help their brothers and sisters out of this epidemic as soon as possible. To sit there do nothing and just blaming China over and over again cannot cure the patients, only by cooperation and looking for solutions together can we solve the problem.\\n\\n\\tThe logic is similar when speaking about China\\'s economy. In a world that is so interdependent and in a year beginning with the uncertainty of the Brexit, no one wants to see the outlook of China\\'s economy dampened by the ongoing coronavirus situation. Only by world cooperation may the pulse of China\\'s economy beat stronger than ever and the world economy would benefit as a whole. By signing the first phase of the trade deal between China and the U.S., President Donald Trump showed a good example of how two powerful countries can and should give the world hope by doing good things together in a faltering time.\\n\\n\\tWalter Russell Mead once said in his masterpiece that America\\'s foreign policy has four schoolmasters, including Hamilton, Wilson, Jackson, and Jefferson. If that theory were not outdated, then the Hamiltonians would advocate cooperation with China, the largest trader with the U.S. now; the Wilsonians would consider American saving the world by saving America first, and with the world so interdependent in the 21st century, they definitely would cooperate with the Chinese to achieve that goal; the Jacksonians would defend U.S. interest in China, so they would also consider working with China to make that happen; only the Jeffersonians would be skeptical about intercourse with China, just as what Mr. Mead depicted in this \"Sick Man of Asia\" article.\\n\\n\\tChina is not the \"Sick Man of Asia\" and it will not be. But something in Mr. Mead\\'s mind must be cured. He is famous for studying the history of America\\'s foreign policy, but he needs to study more about the history of China and the determination of the Chinese people to fight against the novel coronavirus.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2020/0207/c90000-9655005.html'}\n",

In today\\'s world no country could possibly stay aloof to take good care of itself alone.\\n\\n\\tAt the APEC meeting in PNG, convened on board a cruiser anchored by Port Moresby, Xi said, \"We are all indeed fellow passengers in the same boat.\"\\n\\n\\tSAME BOAT\\n\\n\\tIn order to help the world sail forward through wind and waves together, Xi has put forward the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, two important components of what is known as \"Xiplomacy.\"\\n\\n\\tIn a show of their growing global popularity, more than 160 countries and international organizations have signed BRI cooperation documents with China, and Xi\\'s grand vision is being incorporated into more and more UN resolutions.\\n\\n\\t\"I came up with the proposals of building a community with a shared future for mankind and the BRI while pondering on how world countries can achieve joint consultation and shared benefits, harmony in diversity and cooperation for win-win results in the face of divergent interests and concerns,\" Xi told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the sidelines of the G20 summit held in Buenos Aires in November 2018.\\n\\n\\tThere is no better choice for world countries other than strengthening multilateral cooperation in the face of one global challenge after another, Xi said.\\n\\n\\tIn this line of thought, Xi sees his country\\'s development inseparable from that of the rest of the world. \"China will do well only when the world does well,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tAccordingly, experts have observed that Beijing pursues an ever more engaging foreign policy, striving for a stable international environment to enable its development as well as recognizing its global responsibilities as it moves towards center stage.\\n\\n\\t\"To pick one word to exemplify China\\'s foreign policy under President Xi, I would choose \\'engaged\\' or \\'pro-active,\\'\" said Robert Kuhn, a leading U.S. expert on China.\\n\\n\\tChina\\'s engaged diplomacy has been the hallmark of Xi\\'s governance, said Kuhn, who has been paying close attention to every foreign trip made by the Chinese president.\\n\\n\\tThere is now an \"inflection point\" in China\\'s diplomacy, catalyzed by Xi\\'s championing of multilateralism, as the country changes from reactive to pro-active in its international relations, said the expert, also chairman of the Kuhn Foundation.\\n\\n\\tIn the eyes of former French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, who has met Xi about a dozen times, the Chinese leader is full of passion.\\n\\n\\tRaffarin particularly referred to a meeting on global governance Xi attended during his visit to France in March along with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\\n\\n\\tAt the meeting, Xi pledged to uphold multilateralism and pointed out that China and Europe are two major forces in the world, and are important participants in and builders of the economic globalization process.\\n\\n\\tThat gathering, Raffarin said, was the first step towards building \"a new type of multilateralism in the 21st Century.\"\\n\\n\\tAs transformations are taking place in global governance, the current more than seven-decade-old multilateral system needs fresh impetus, he said.\\n\\n\\tIn terms of strength, Asia and Africa are now very different from what they were after World War II, and they should be properly represented in the multilateral system, added the French statesman.\\n\\n\\t\"SWISS ARMY KNIFE\"\\n\\n\\tExpounding on his vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind at the UN Office at Geneva in early 2017, Xi recalled the first time he got a Swiss army knife.\\n\\n\\tHe said he was amazed that it has so many functions and could not help thinking \"how wonderful it would be if an exquisite Swiss army knife could be made for our world affairs. When there is a problem, we can use the knife to fix it.\"\\n\\n\\tIn the eyes of many, such a multi-functional kit for world cooperation is already unfolding.\\n\\n\\tAhead of a trip to Beijing in April, Guterres told the press that through the BRI, China has created development opportunities.\\n\\n\\tThere are more investments, trade and growth, which not only contribute to poverty reduction, employment and improvement of infrastructure in developing countries, but also promote environmental construction and social stability and development, said the UN chief.\\n\\n\\tThe secret of the BRI\\'s success is partly attributable to the fact that it is based upon China\\'s understanding of multilateralism.\\n\\n\\tThe essence of multilateralism, said Xi at the BRICS summit in Brasilia, is that international affairs should be addressed through extensive consultation rather than decided by one country or a few.\\n\\n\\tUpholding the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, Xi put forward the BRI in 2013, the same year he assumed office as Chinese president. The initiative has now become the most popular platform for international cooperation in the world.\\n\\n\\t\"Dominance by a single party is not allowed in the BRI,\" Xi said in a tour of the Piraeus Port, a flagship project of BRI cooperation between China and Greece, during his recent visit to the European country.\\n\\n\\t\"Instead, all participants would share responsibilities and benefits in BRI cooperation,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tThe BRI offers grand principles to support its grand visions such as building a community with a shared future for mankind, Kuhn said, adding that it expands links between Asia, Africa and Europe and thus reduces imbalances in national development and promotes economic growth.\\n\\n\\t\"There are different kinds of flowers with different colors in our gardens and we can make beautiful garland by joining the flowers together,\" said Nepali President Bidhya Devi Bhandari in an interview with Xinhua earlier this year. \"The BRI can make a beautiful garland.\"\\n\\n\\tRaffarin, a frequent visitor to China since his first trip in 1970, observed that China\\'s diplomatic vision is deeply rooted in and inspired by its traditional culture, which believes that cooperation is better than confrontation.\\n\\n\\tThe BRI is a great initiative to promote global cooperation, he told Xinhua in an interview in September.\\n\\n\\t\"In this world of interdependence, we must expand our thinking beyond all forms of nationalism to assume our common destiny. For all this, China will remain useful to the world,\" he said.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/1120/c90000-9633723.html'}\n"

The value of its existence has been frequently doubted since the end of the Cold War\\n\\n\\tOn Feb. 16, German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized the â\\x80\\x9cgo-it-aloneâ\\x80\\x9d approach of the US at the Munich Security Conference, warning that the US shall not exclude Europe in its plans for nuclear disarmament as well as withdrawal of troops from Syria and trade.\\n\\n\\tHalf a year later, Macron pointed out at an ambassadorsâ\\x80\\x99 conference that the US is a long-term ally of France, but also one that has long abducted France. His remarks have made him another leader of a major European country that has bluntly presented disputes between Europe and the US.\\n\\n\\tâ\\x80\\x9cYou have no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the United States and its Nato allies. None. You have an uncoordinated aggressive action by another Nato ally, Turkey, in an area where our interests are at stake.â\\x80\\x9d What Macron said was considered as his fiercest criticism against the US, as well as the strongest doubt over the NATO, triggering huge attention from the international community.\\n\\n\\tâ\\x80\\x9cAt present, obvious changes are happening within Europe-US relations, with rising disputes,â\\x80\\x9d said Liu Mingli, deputy director of the Institute of European Studies, China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations during an interview with Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s Daily Online.\\n\\n\\tHe pointed out that in both the aspects of trade and economy, Europe has become an important object of taxation for the US, and the two also share different values as the US is not supportive of the European integration and the calling on of some countries to follow the UKâ\\x80\\x99s exit of the EU. Besides, US President Donald Trump is also asking European countries to raise military spending and shoulder more security responsibilities.\\n\\n\\tLiu believes that from Macronâ\\x80\\x99s recent remarks, it can be inferred that the disputes over NATO between the US and the EU have not been alleviated, but indeed have deteriorated. He said the â\\x80\\x9cbrain deathâ\\x80\\x9d remarks reveal dissatisfaction regarding US policies, and will spur the EU to rethink over its policy orientation in its own security issues.\\n\\n\\tMacron told The Economist that Washingtonâ\\x80\\x99s policies are very uncertain, and there is no coordination between the US and its NATO allies in decision making. He said European countries shall no longer be protected by the US, or they will not be in control of their own destiny.\\n\\n\\tMacron noted that it would be a mistake for the Europe to try to isolate Russia, and a dialogue with the latter should be re-opened. This has been appraised by Russia â\\x80\\x93 a major â\\x80\\x9cthreatâ\\x80\\x9d of the NATO. The spokesperson of Russian Foreign Ministry said the French Presidentâ\\x80\\x99s statement reflected the truth, and was a clear definition of NATOâ\\x80\\x99s current situation.\\n\\n\\tXing Hua, researcher from China Institute of International Studies, noted that France has always been â\\x80\\x9ccourageousâ\\x80\\x9d when it comes to the US and NATO. The country advocates for freedom of the European countries to decide their own security, he said, adding that France is against the complete opposition between itself and Russia especially after the Ukrainian crisis. This reflects the two major diplomatic points of emphasis of France â\\x80\\x93 to advocate for its independence and safeguard its status as a major country.\\n\\n\\tXing believes that NATO has been aware of the doubts over the value of its existence since the end of the Cold War, and has been taking reforms in this regard. However, it considers Russia as the biggest threat and has reinforced military pressure against the country. Currently, the US and its NATO allies are having a â\\x80\\x9cCold Warâ\\x80\\x9d-like relationship with Russia, and NATO has become an initiator of the issues that threaten the security of Europe.\\n\\n\\tMacron said at this yearâ\\x80\\x99s ambassadorsâ\\x80\\x99 conference that â\\x80\\x9cWe are probably in the process of experiencing the end of Western hegemony around the world.â\\x80\\x9d The West has enjoyed an absolute economic and political domination during the past 300 years, and he holds that things change, and this will no longer exist in the future.\\n\\n\\tâ\\x80\\x9cNATO will have to shift its functions in the future,â\\x80\\x9d Liu said.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/1109/c90000-9630854.html'}\n",

But in fact, it was the US that was not complying with the treaty, said Buzhinskiy.\\n\\n\\tThere are far more medium- and small-sized countries in the world than major countries, and their stance and views are important, Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, director of the Center for Security Cooperation of the Office for International Military Cooperation at China\\'s Ministry of National Defense, told the Global Times on Tuesday.\\n\\n\\tWest-led defense forums didn\\'t give them such chances, but the Xiangshan Forum has provided a platform for them to communicate to the world, Zhou noted.\\n\\n\\tA chance for US to listen\\n\\n\\tSenior Colonel Zhao Xiaozhuo, director of the Beijing Xiangshan Forum Secretariat, told the reporters that through the forum, \"We have a better understanding of the different stance and views on various issues\" of many high ranking figures from different countries.\\n\\n\\tJiang stressed that the forum also welcomes the US delegation, which is also a chance for the US to listen to what other countries really think of its policies. US Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary for China Chad Sbragia attended the Xiangshan Forum.\\n\\n\\tChinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng also made similar points on unilateral approach on Tuesday, saying that no country can prosper without working with other nations. The world wants China and the US to end their trade war, Le said. \"That requires openness rather than a \\'de-coupling\\' of countries or a new Cold War,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tMore senior military officials around the world are attending the forum because of China\\'s increasing influence in international security affairs, Zhou noted.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/1023/c90000-9625509.html'}\n"

Photo: Xinhua\\n\\n\\tRussian President Vladimir Putin on October 3 spoke of helping \"Chinese partners create a missile attack warning system\" at the final plenary session of the 16th meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club in Sochi, Russia. The \"big secret\" has drawn attention of international media due to not only the way Putin revealed it but also the context in which it was revealed.\\n\\n\\tPutin said the system is very important and \"will drastically increase China\\'s defense capability.\" Putin\\'s words, which carry the weight of credibility, show Russian confidence in its military technology and strategic capability.\\n\\n\\tFirst, Russia has its own reliable anti-missile system and is experienced in dealing with missile threat posed by the US. Russian military has paid attention to missile defense system since the days of the Soviet Union and has deployed and upgraded the system for years.\\n\\n\\tRussia enjoys ideal geographical conditions to develop an anti-missile system. It is feasible for the country to assist its strategic partners develop a warning system and even a missile defense system.\\n\\n\\tSecond, the cooperation that Putin was referring to is in line with China\\'s need to increase its strategic capabilities. The missile attack warning system is an important part of an anti-missile system and nuclear counterattack capability\\n\\n\\tAs China\\'s missile striking capability, space surveillance technology and missile launch capability have increased, to integrate and perfect anti-missile defense system is a necessity for China.\\n\\n\\tMore importantly, Putin\\'s remarks amid tensions between China and the US showed the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era between China and Russia. The remarks also reflected the fact that Beijing and Moscow have been deepening political trust and cooperation.\\n\\n\\tAfter withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, the US has showed a clearer intent of strengthening its strategic containment of China and Russia. China-Russia cooperation on missile warning system is aimed to deal with the increasing threat by the US.\\n\\n\\tAs the INF treaty has collapsed, the US would probably speed up its deployment of intermediate-range missiles in regions surrounding China and Russia, which makes it all the more necessary for the two countries to strengthen their missile defense capability.\\n\\n\\tChina would need not only to forewarn intercontinental ballistic missiles coming from the other side of the Pacific Ocean but also to keep an eye on possible attacks by intermediate-range missiles. Such being the case, China needs a more sensitive missile attack warning system that can cover longer ranges and detect incoming missiles faster, so as to buy time for defense and retaliation.\\n\\n\\tThe US is developing missile technology while simultaneously improving anti-missile defense. This is another reason for China and Russia to strengthen cooperation on missile attack warning system. In the meantime, Russia\\'s concept and experience plus China\\'s strategic input capability make it possible for the two countries\\' joint development and research to be better.\\n\\n\\tTo coordinate with its Indo-Pacific Strategy, the US is sparing no effort at wooing allies and ratcheting up the trade war against China and economic sanctions on Russia. Washington is stepping up strategic competition.\\n\\n\\tThe possibility that the US launches a new round of strategic operations to infringe on core national interests of China and Russia cannot be ruled out. Therefore, it is more urgent than before for Beijing and Moscow to be prepared. They need to establish reliable strategic deterrence capability and prevent the breakout of war. Meanwhile, the two countries should have a powerful voice and the will to express their strategic demand.\\n\\n\\tThe author is a professor at the National Defense University of People\\'s Liberation Army.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/1015/c90000-9623099.html'}\n",

      "124,{'發稿日': ['September16', '2019'], '新聞標題': 'China can play more active role in mediating Japan-South Korea spat', '作者': 'Global Times', '新聞內文': \"Editor's Note:\\n\\n\\tThe brewing spat between Japan and South Korea after Seoul's withdrawal from the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) marks a new low in Seoul-Tokyo relations. What's driving Seoul's decision to withdraw from the pact? Will it cast a shadow on the US alliance system in East Asia? Moon Chung-in (Moon), special advisor for foreign affairs and national security to South Korean President Moon Jae-in and distinguished professor at Yonsei University, shared his insights with Global Times (GT) reporter Li Aixin on these issues during the Third Taihe Civilizations Forum held in Beijing in early September.\\n\\n\\tGT: What are the main reasons for South Korea's withdrawal from the intelligence-sharing pact with Japan?\\n\\n\\tMoon: Very simple. In early July, the Japanese government imposed export control against South Korea. In August, Japan demoted South Korea from the list of A-category countries to B-category countries (in trade). Japan took restrictive economic punishment against South Korea. Japan argued that it is imposing economic restrictions because it does not trust South Korea. Our government believes the GSOMIA cannot be implemented if Japan does not trust us. If Japan does not trust us, how can we exchange sensitive military intelligence with them?\\n\\n\\tGT: Under the backdrop of the GSOMIA collapse and escalating tensions between South Korea and Japan, how do you think US alliance system in East Asia will develop?\\n\\n\\tMoon: We usually call it the trilateral security cooperation and coordination among Washington, Tokyo and Seoul, because we do not have any military alliance with Japan.\\n\\n\\tYes, it was true that in the past, the US intervened to narrow the differences between Seoul and Tokyo. For example, in 2015, when there was a conflict between the two countries over the comfort women issue, the Barack Obama administration intervened and narrowed differences so the two countries could reach an agreement on the issue.\\n\\n\\tHowever, the Trump administration did not intervene, and has said that it is a matter between Japan and South Korea. Maybe that is one reason why the conflict between Japan and South Korea became deeper.\\n\\n\\tGT: Will the move affect the South Korea-US alliance?\\n\\n\\tMoon: A lot of South Korean conservatives and Washington's mainstream (politicians) argue that South Korea's failure to renew GSOMIA will undermine the alliance. However, we should understand one thing that GMOSIA is between Japan and South Korea. The US has nothing to do with the agreement, even though it was the US which mediated Japan and South Korea to sign the agreement.\\n\\n\\tFurthermore, we have a Trilateral Information Sharing Arrangement (TISA) that involves US, Japan, and South Korea. So I don't think our decision not to renew the GSOMIA will affect the South Korea-US alliance negatively.\\n\\n\\tWashington must be very disappointed, because the US always wants Japan and South Korea to have close military cooperation and coordination, including the exchange of military information.\\n\\n\\tHowever, our government thinks the South Korea-US alliance is healthy. We have a mechanism to exchange information with Japan through US mediation.\\n\\n\\tGT: Lately, observers say there might be some friction between South Korea and the US, since President Trump has been pushing for South Korea to pay more for US troops, while South Korea has recently pushed for a prompt return of US military bases in the country. Do you think such friction exists?\\n\\n\\tMoon: Yes. The overall structure of South Korean-US alliance system remains intact. We have a defense treaty between South Korea and the US. We have a combined forces command between US and South Korea, and we have US troops in South Korea, and there is a relative strong support of US forces in South Korea and the alliance by South Korean people. We have been paying defense costs for US troops in the country. Therefore, from an overall structural point of view, the South Korea-US alliance remains intact.\\n\\n\\tBut there are some pending issues that might need adjustment. For example, the Trump administration has been putting a lot of pressure on South Korea to increase defense costs. Last year, we agreed to pay $1 billion for US forces. Now, the US is demanding that we pay about $5 to $6 billion. That's too much. This will lead to disputes between the US and South Korea.\\n\\n\\tAnother issue is that the US just hinted it might need to set up bases for its intermediate range ballistic missiles in South Korea. But our government officially said no. That could become a future problem.\\n\\n\\tThere's another issue, the so-called return of wartime operational control, which belongs to the US commander in South Korea, to South Korea. So far, everything is going well. But in the process, there could be some difference of opinion between Washington and Seoul. I believe that we will overcome those differences because alliance is a tool for enhancing our national interest.\\n\\n\\tThe US has its national interests. South Korea has its national interests. From time to time, there can be differences in their priorities. Therefore, it is natural for us to have differences in terms of defining national interests. But I think we will adjust to the differences.\\n\\n\\tGT: Will the differences between South Korea and the US bring Seoul and Pyongyang closer?\\n\\n\\tMoon: It is important for North Korea and the US to have a more productive negotiation about the nuclear issue. If the US-North Korea relations get better, then there is a great chance for improved inter-Korean relations.\\n\\n\\tGT: After South Korean President Moon Jae-in assumed office, the crisis on the Korean Peninsula has been eased. But the fundamental problems remain, such as the distrust between Seoul and Pyongyang. After Kim-Trump summits, there have been few improvements on the Korean Peninsula issue. How do you think the situation on Korean Peninsula will further develop? What can relevant parties do to break the current stalemate?\\n\\n\\tMoon: The Korean Peninsula has gone through a roller-coaster pattern of interactions. 2017 was the year of crisis. 2019 was the year of great hope for peace. This year, we are facing precarious uncertainties. One of the reasons is the failure to reach an agreement in Hanoi between Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un in February. On June 30, Trump and Kim met in Panmunjom. The two leaders agreed to resume working level talks within two to three weeks.\\n\\n\\tIt was later discovered that the Trump agreed with Kim to suspend a South Korea-US joint military training exercise. But we continued with the exercise on a much smaller scale. North Korea considers this is a hostile activity against Pyongyang.\\n\\n\\tI think that is one reason why North Korea has not attended working level talks. But there is another factor, if North Korean officers show up at the talks, then North Korean officials should get some tangible outcomes. Apparently, they might have not read any such signs from the US. Therefore, they are not confident that the working level talks will produce very tangible outcomes, and those two reasons might have prevented North Korea from attending the working level talks.\\n\\n\\tGT: China-Japan-South Korea Trilateral Foreign Ministers' Meeting was held in Beijing. What role do you think can China play in mediating the conflicts between South Korea and Japan?\\n\\n\\tMoon: China can be an important mediator between Japan and South Korea. Up until now, the US played the role, but it is time for China to play that role, because cooperation among China, Japan, South Korea is extremely important for peace and stability, as well as the common prosperity in Northeast Asia. I hope China will play a more active role in narrowing the difference between Japan and South Korea, and I hope that China would take a more proactive diplomacy in promoting peace, stability, and common prosperity in Northeast Asia.\\n\\n\\tGT: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. What do you think is the biggest change in China over the past 70 years?\\n\\n\\tMoon: It's an amazing transformation. Look at Chinese history. You won the war against the Kuomintang. Then you get into the Korean War (1950-53). After that there was a lot of chaos in China. You had a famine, and the Cultural Revolution (1967-77). From 1949 up until 1978 was rather gloomy. However, Deng Xiaoping's adoption of the Four Cardinal Principles in 1979 and the pursuit of reform and opening-up greatly transformed China.\\n\\n\\tChina has gone through enormous transformation. China has become No.2 country in the world in terms of economic power. China is No.1 exporting country in the world. China is No.1 in terms of foreign exchange reserves. Now you're pushing the Belt and Road Initiative. The new China is a completely different China, nobody would have expected that kind of transformation. Therefore, I would say the last 70 years have been the greatest success story for China. Of course, success always brings new challenges.\\n\\n\\tThe current trade conflict with the US might mirror that kind of new challenge. Also you have a lot of domestic problems, including growing inequality in China, environmental problems and resources problems. You have 56 different ethnic groups in China. Unity among diversity has become another big challenge. But as you transformed yourself in the past 70 years, I believe you will overcome those challenges so that you can celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of PRC in 2049. Maybe by then you might be able to achieve the Chinese Dream.\", '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/0916/c90000-9615003.html'}\n"

In 1778, he wrote another poem suggesting that these \"Han objects\" might belong to an earlier time.\\n\\n\\tBut, as we know today, these objects are far older than the emperor could have realized.\\n\\n\\tThe Qing ruler may not have been able to imagine that he was having a dialogue with an object dating back 5,000 years. However, modern-day visitors to the Forbidden City in Beijing, which is also known as the Palace Museum, can experience a panoramic view of the brilliant jade civilization of Liangzhu Culture, which was based in what is today\\'s Hangzhou, Zhejiang province.\\n\\n\\tOn July 6, the Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City in Hangzhou were inscribed onto the UNESCO World Heritage list, which recognizes the significance of the site as an indicator of the early stages of Chinese civilization. The city was inhabited for a millennium from 3300 to 2300 BC, according to archaeological research.\\n\\n\\tJust 10 days later, the exhibition Ancient China: A 5,000-year Civilization Demonstrated by Jade opened at the Palace Museum, just in time to feed public curiosity and unveil the charm of this realm of deities and kings. Nearly 260 objects, including Emperor Qianlong\\'s precious jade collection, gathered from 17 museums and research institutes nationwide, have gone on display at the Hall of Martial Valor at the Palace Museum for this major occasion. The exhibition will run through Oct 20.\\n\\n\\t\"Almost accidentally, Qianlong was probably the first researcher into Liangzhu jades,\" says Gao Menghe, chief curator of the exhibition and an archaeology professor at Shanghai\\'s Fudan University, half-jokingly.\\n\\n\\t\"As Liangzhu was one of the earliest known palatial cities in China, and the Forbidden City is the last royal palace of Chinese imperial times, we can feel an interesting chemistry running through time in this space,\" he says.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x904ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x905ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/0725/c90000-9600390.html'}\n"

Frederic Pierucci, former executive of French rail transport company Alstom, detailed a similar story in his book The American Trap. In a recent exclusive interview with Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s Daily Online, Frederic recalled his own experience with the long-arm jurisdiction of the U.S. and his subsequent battle.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tOn April 14, 2013, Frederic Pierucci, an executive of Alstom, a French power and transportation conglomerate, was arrested by the FBI when his plane arrived at New York\\'s John F. Kennedy International Airport. He was charged with bribing Indonesian officials to win a power plant contract.\\n\\n\\tBut the indictment was not a simple anti-corruption probe, as Pierucci, then president of the French power titan\\'s boiler subsidiary, argued in his book The American Trap, where he unveiled how the U.S. law enforcement departments used its anti-corruption laws to pursue anti-corruption investigations into non-U.S. companies worldwide.\\n\\n\\tThe â\\x80\\x9cAmerica trapâ\\x80\\x9d was set for non-U.S. countries, enterprises and individuals, Pierucci said, adding that any international company targeted by the U.S. justice department could not escape the intervention of the U.S. anti-corruption laws.\\n\\n\\tStep by step, the U.S. government is taking control of the core industries and highly competitive companies of other countries.\\n\\n\\tThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) came into force in 1977. It was meant to punish American companies involved in overseas bribery. But the Americans re-adopted the act and gave it extraterritoriality.\\n\\n\\tThe FCPA had brought in penalties of more than 10 billion euros for the U.S. since 2005. Of the penalties, 60 percent were from European companies, while only 15 percent were from American companies.\\n\\n\\tThe FCPA has caused French companies to pay $14 billion to the U.S. government. While in prison, Pierucci did a lot of research and concluded that most of the defendants would plead guilty and cooperated with U.S. law enforcement departments even though there was no evidence of a crime.\\n\\n\\tHe stressed that the act has lately taken aim at Russian companies and tomorrow it could also steer towards Chinese companies.\\n\\n\\tThe FCPA is also a trap set for individuals, Pierucci said. Alstom was not cooperative at the beginning. The U.S. Department of Justice, which had lost patience in the process, decided to take actions starting from bringing charges against Pierucci.\\n\\n\\tIn April 2013, Pierucci was arrested by the FBI. He later learned that he had been already sued in November 2012 for violating the FCPA.\\n\\n\\tPierucci remembered that the American prosecutor told him that if the U.S. had publicly sued him, he would have applied to take refuge in France and the U.S. would have been unable to take action against him.\\n\\n\\tPierucci was not allowed to call the French embassy, consulate, nor his company. The prosecutor wanted him to act as a traitor of Alstom. In addition, he was told that he couldn\\'t be released on bail. Pierucci thought such judicial procedure was incomprehensible.\\n\\n\\tPierucci was in prison for a total of 25 months. In the beginning 14 months, he was locked in the most heavily guarded room in the U.S. It was quite a difficult time for him.\\n\\n\\tIn the case of Alstom\\'s acquisition by General Electric, the U.S. obtained the power to maintain all French nuclear power plants, which provided 75% of France\\'s electricity. In Pierucciâ\\x80\\x99s view, what the U.S. did to France, a significant country when it comes to nuclear power technology, is undoubtedly a serious violation of French industrial sovereignty.\\n\\n\\tIn November 2016, France introduced the Sapin II law, an anti-corruption law on transparency, anti-corruption and economic modernization.\\n\\n\\tThe law allows French companies to accept anti-corruption investigations at home. Pierucci believes the law is the most urgent response a country could make to mitigate the impact of a U.S.-initiated trade war, as well as an attempt to fix the already unbalanced international economic relationship.\\n\\n\\tThe American Trap has promoted public understanding of Alstomâ\\x80\\x99s acquisition by General Electric, and reminded French people to stay vigilant against the \"American trap.\"\\n\\n\\tNowadays, Pierucci has set up a consulting firm to advise government agencies and multinational corporations on issues such as how to protect their core industries and industrial sovereignty, and how to deal with U.S. judicial intervention and protect the interests of multinational corporations.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/0705/c90000-9594965.html'}\n",

Many countries were happy to try to frame their monetary and fiscal policy response in a collective way, which allowed observers to comprehend the massive scale of their effort, he said.\\n\\n\\t\"However, what to do when there is no imminent crisis making headlines all over the world?\" O\\'Neill asked.\\n\\n\\tThe G20, formed in 1999, brings together the most important industrialized and developing economies to discuss international economic and financial stability. Its annual summit, a gathering of G20 leaders that debuted in 2008, has evolved into a major forum for deliberating economic issues and other pressing global concerns. Bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit have occasionally led to major international agreements or underscored existing hostilities.\\n\\n\\tIt comprises 19 countries and the European Union. The countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.\\n\\n\\tBecause of their size, the countries\\' policies play a big role in determining the health of the global economy.\\n\\n\\tTogether, the nations of the G20 account for around 80 percent of global economic output, nearly 75 percent of all global trade and about 66 percent of the world\\'s population.\\n\\n\\tThese figures have remained relatively stable, while the corresponding contributions for the G7, a smaller group of advanced economies, have shrunk as emerging markets take up a relatively greater share of the world\\'s economy, Council of Foreign Relations staff members James McBride and Andrew Chatzky wrote in a backgrounder published recently on the website of the US think tank.\\n\\n\\tWhile some are skeptical about the G20\\'s usefulness, they said, many observers point out that its membership is more representative of the current international balance of power than other blocs formed earlier like the G7, which came into being in 1976.\\n\\n\\tThe G20 initially focused on broad macroeconomic policy, but has expanded its ambit, McBride and Chatzky wrote. Last year\\'s summit in Argentina focused on fair and sustainable development, while the previous one in Germany addressed issues including corruption, money laundering, and international tax havens. At the 2016 summit in China, President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama formally announced their countries\\' accession to the Paris Agreement on combating climate change.\\n\\n\\tAs part of the preparations for the Osaka G20 summit, the world\\'s leading think tanks held a meeting in Tokyo on May 26-27 to work out policy recommendations for the leaders.\\n\\n\\tThe meeting, known as the Think 20 or T20, is the research and policy advice network for G20 countries. More than 400 think tank experts from the 20 countries sent a message in Tokyo that political leaders must adhere to the principles of multilateralism despite currents of anti-globalism and economic uncertainty.\\n\\n\\tNaoyuki Yoshino, chairman of T20 Japan and dean of the Asian Development Bank Institute, said the recommendations of the policy experts were based on theoretical and empirical analysis, ensuring that G20 leaders received the most accurate advice.\\n\\n\\t\"The G20 countries have taken steps closer to the new global goal of a sustainable, inclusive and resilient society with the Paris Agreement and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development but still face challenges on the way ahead,\" Yoshino said in the T20 Japan statement.\\n\\n\\tHe said T20 Japan, through the work of its 10 policy task forces, had produced innovative and evidence-based recommendations to guide the way forward for the global community.\\n\\n\\tIn a message posted on the G20\\'s website, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan is determined to lead global economic growth at the Osaka summit by promoting free trade and innovation, achieving both economic growth and the reduction of disparities, and contributing to the development agenda and other global issues with the UN\\'s Sustainable Development Goals at its core.\\n\\n\\tHe said Japan will lead discussions on the supply of global commons such as quality infrastructure and healthcare for realizing economic growth around the world, adding that ways to resolve issues such as climate change and the amount of plastic waste in oceans will also be discussed.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/0627/c90000-9591829.html'}\n",

(Xinhua/Pang Xinglei)\\n\\n\\tBEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping will be in Central Asia from Wednesday to Sunday for state visits to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and for the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and that of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA).\\n\\n\\tAgainst the backdrop of growing uncertainties worldwide, his trip is expected to further consolidate multi-dimensional cooperation within the frameworks of the SCO and the CICA and pool efforts to create a shared future of security and prosperity for all countries in the region.\\n\\n\\tCONSOLIDATE SCO COOPERATION\\n\\n\\tLeaders of the SCO member states will gather in Kyrgyzstan\\'s capital of Bishkek for this year\\'s summit and are expected to declare a unified stance on major regional and international issues.\\n\\n\\tWhen the SCO was founded in June 2001, its primary mission was to build mutual trust, safeguard trans-border security and boost anti-terrorism cooperation.\\n\\n\\tOver the past 18 years, the SCO has grown into the world\\'s largest regional organization for comprehensive cooperation in terms of both the area it covers and the population it represents. Cooperation among member states has been largely enriched in such fields as security, economy and people-to-people exchanges.\\n\\n\\tAs for the SCO\\'s next stage of development, Xi, in a speech at the SCO Qingdao summit in 2018, called on countries involved in the regional bloc to work closely to build an SCO community with a shared future.\\n\\n\\tThe SCO can take a leap forward in promoting the building of such a community, said Shi Ze, standing director of the Chinese Center for Shanghai Cooperation Organization Studies.\\n\\n\\tBecause the SCO member states are faced with common challenges in security and economic development, they share a broad consensus on many issues, he added.\\n\\n\\tDuring the SCO summit, Xi will exchange views with leaders of the participating countries on the status quo and prospects of SCO\\'s development, as well as major international and regional issues. The leaders will \"discuss new ideas and new measures to jointly address risks and challenges, and promote security, stability, development and revitalization under the current situation,\" according to Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanhui.\\n\\n\\tIn fact, under the guidance of its bedrock principle -- the Shanghai Spirit, the SCO has been steadily advancing to achieve the goal. It has become an influential force in combating the \"three evil forces\" of terrorism, separatism and extremism, as well as in cracking down on cross-border and cyber crimes.\\n\\n\\tMeanwhile, practical cooperation among member states in military, energy, transport, telecommunication, infrastructure and agriculture has been yielding tangible results and bringing concrete benefits to the people in the region and beyond.\\n\\n\\tAt this year\\'s summit, member states will adopt a series of important documents and further promote multilateral cooperation within the SCO framework, according to SCO Secretary-General Vladimir Norov.\\n\\n\\tBRING PROSPERITY TO ASIA\\n\\n\\tLike SCO member states, many Asian countries also need to deal with traditional and non-traditional security challenges including the \"three evil forces\" -- drug trafficking, extreme poverty and border disputes.\\n\\n\\tAt the same time, the return of a Cold-War mentality, hegemony and zero-sum games has posed serious threats to the stability and security of the world as well as Asia. Only by working together can countries overcome these challenges and achieve prosperity and development for themselves and for the region as a whole.\\n\\n\\tAs the only active Pan-Asian multilateral mechanism on security cooperation, the CICA has been actively enhancing mutual trust between its member states with measures being taken in areas including military and politics.\\n\\n\\tEstablished in 1992, the CICA was a forum for dialogue and consultation on security issues in Asia. Through years of joint efforts, the mechanism has been a security cooperation forum that has the widest coverage, the largest membership and the most adequate representation in Asia, and it has played an important and constructive role in promoting regional stability and prosperity.\\n\\n\\tSecurity cooperation is the root of the SCO and the CICA, noted Shi. Enhancing cooperation in this area is the fundamental demand of member states of both organizations to tackle changes of situation in the Eurasian region, he said.\\n\\n\\tTherefore, security cooperation will be the core topic on the agenda of the SCO summit in Bishkek and the CICA summit in Dushanbe, said Shi.\\n\\n\\tLeaders need to negotiate on this issue and find suitable solutions to address those security challenges and threats, he added.\\n\\n\\tCEMENT BILATERAL TIES\\n\\n\\tIn recent years, China has been continuously improving its relations with central Asian countries under the guidance of principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness.\\n\\n\\tIn Kyrgyzstan, China has provided assistance to the construction of medical facilities by building the Osh Hospital and a congenital heart disease research center. China also helped repair roads in Bishkek and strengthen security capability of the country.\\n\\n\\tKyrgyz President Sooronbai Jeenbekov commented that China is a close neighbor, reliable friend and strategic partner of his country.\\n\\n\\tTajikistan, the world\\'s first country to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the Silk Road Economic Belt with China, has been experiencing accelerated economic development with China\\'s assistance.\\n\\n\\tThe country\\'s key sectors such as infrastructure, energy and electricity as well as communications and transportation have achieved huge breakthroughs in development.\\n\\n\\tAt present, China has become a major trade partner and investor of both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. China\\'s cooperation with the two countries in transport, infrastructure, trade and mining have been consistently deepened. Learning the Chinese language and studying in China have become popular choices of local youth.\\n\\n\\tXi\\'s visits are expected to further promote comprehensive strategic partnerships with the two countries and promote practical cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.\\n\\n\\tMoreover, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang said, the heads of state will transform high-level political mutual trust into more tangible cooperation results, and ensure that the bilateral relationships will achieve greater development under the new situation.\\n\\n\\tYao Peisheng, former Chinese ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, said China and central Asian countries including Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have already formed a community with a shared future, which will be taken as a paradigm for China\\'s relations with other neighboring countries.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x904ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x905ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/0611/c90000-9586443.html'}\n",

(Xinhua/Wang Ying)\\n\\n\\tNEW YORK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Margo Fan bought four pairs of running shoes for herself in a single go when visiting an open-air outlet mall in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\\n\\n\\t\"Each pair costs me only about 50 (U.S.) dollars. (Since) trade war is getting tense, there will be no such good deal soon. I\\'d better stock up some,\" Fan told Xinhua.\\n\\n\\tFan is among the many anxiety-ridden U.S. residents who are preparing for higher price tags in big and small retailer stores across the country following the latest flare-up of U.S.-China trade tensions.\\n\\n\\tTWO ECONOMIES LOCKED SYMBIOTICALLY\\n\\n\\tTheir concern is not for no reason at all.\\n\\n\\tWashington abruptly increased additional tariffs on 200 billion U.S. dollars\\' worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent in May when trade negotiations were still going on, and has threatened to raise tariffs on more Chinese imports.\\n\\n\\tThe trade group Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America estimated that the tariffs could cost U.S. consumers 7 billion dollars a year, as in 2018, 69 percent of all shoes sold in the United States came from China.\\n\\n\\tMore than 170 shoe companies and retailers have warned the new U.S. tariffs, recognized by some as the newest U.S. attempt to decouple itself from China, would be \"catastrophic.\"\\n\\n\\t\"It is utterly unrealistic to uncouple China and the U.S. economically. The two economies are symbiotically connected and are too interdependent to be pried apart,\" said Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank Institute for China-America Studies, in a recent interview with Xinhua.\\n\\n\\t\"There might be scope to build some separation\" within an \"extremely narrow list\" of high-end technologies where the United States enjoys monopoly control and low-end production goods which are fit for relocation to other Asian countries, he said.\\n\\n\\t\"But for the vast, remaining billions-upon-billions of dollars of two-way trade, investment and intellectual property rights transfers, the possibility of decoupling is utterly unrealistic,\" Gupta noted.\\n\\n\\tAccording to a white paper released by the Chinese government on Sunday, China and the United States are each other\\'s largest trading partner. In 2018, bilateral trade in goods and services exceeded 750 billion dollars, and the two-way direct investment approached 160 billion dollars.\\n\\n\\tTrade with China helps each U.S. family save 850 dollars per year, according to China\\'s Ministry of Commerce. From lamps to birthday candles, from flip-flops to mouse traps, \"Made in China\" goods have long become an indispensable part of the everyday life for many U.S. households.\\n\\n\\tMore than 900,000 U.S. jobs depend on producing goods and services exported to China and more than 2.6 million jobs in the United States and many millions more in China depend on two-way trade between the two countries, said former U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke.\\n\\n\\t\"So people in both countries are benefiting from this deepening economic integration,\" said Locke, also former governor of U.S. state of Washington and former U.S. Secretary of Commerce.\\n\\n\\tDECOUPLING U.S.-CHINA SPELLS \"ECONOMIC DISASTER\"\\n\\n\\tTo decouple the U.S. and Chinese economies would spell \"an economic disaster,\" damaging both countries and the entire world, warned Robert Kuhn, chairman of the Kuhn Foundation, in a recent interview with Xinhua.\\n\\n\\tIt is \"unacceptable\" to the world to undo the economic interdependence between the two countries because it will lead to irreversible damage to global supply chains, Kuhn said.\\n\\n\\tIt would take years to recover some, but never all of the disruption, and might take a decade or more to reverse the mistake, Kuhn said.\\n\\n\\t\"As serious as the likely near-term impact is, a tariff war would have far worse long-term consequences for the U.S. economy,\" said Kaushik Basu, professor of economics at Cornell University and non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in an article titled \"The trade war will do America more harm than good.\"\\n\\n\\t\"This is because a large share of U.S. imports from China are production inputs. Higher tariffs will make those inputs more expensive or scarcer, hurting U.S. productivity and competitiveness and taking a deep bite out of the economy\\'s growth potential,\" Basu said.\\n\\n\\tIn 2018, for example, the United States imported 29.8 billion dollars worth of clothing from China and a further 20 billion dollars worth of leather and related goods, according to Basu.\\n\\n\\tRebecca Mond, vice president of federal government affairs at the Toy Association, told Xinhua that the new tariffs will hit the toy industry hard.\\n\\n\\t\"One thing is clear, however, a mass shift of production out of China is not a viable option for our industry. The infrastructure, capacity and workforce to meet consumer demand does not exist anywhere else.\"\\n\\n\\tHigher tariffs on these products are likely to hit U.S. consumers, he noted. But the United States spent far more on production inputs, including 186.5 billion dollars on computers and electronics, and a combined 88.6 billion dollars on electrical equipment and machinery.\\n\\n\\t\"If tariffs on these goods remain high, the U.S. risks being outcompeted by other countries in the same way that it outcompeted Japan after the 1980s,\" Basu said.\\n\\n\\tCALL OFF TRADE WAR BEFORE IT\\'S TOO LATE\\n\\n\\t\"The truth is that Chinese-American trade is a pillar of the international economic landscape, facilitating high growth\" for the two countries and \"benefiting the rest of the world,\" said Dr. Gary Hufbauer, economist and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in his article \"Trump must call off escalating U.S.-China trade war before it\\'s too late.\"\\n\\n\\t\"We need a comprehensive agreement with China that addresses rightful U.S. concerns, not a trade war,\" he said.\\n\\n\\t\"He (Trump) can call off an escalating trade war that inflates consumer prices and endangers job gains,\" Hufbauer said. \"Free and fair trade with China, not more tariffs, is the real path to prosperity.\"\\n\\n\\tGupta said he is positive that the United States and China could finally figure out a solution to the trade disputes.\\n\\n\\t\"I think there\\'s still a good deal of good faith among the negotiators, but it\\'s a very difficult negotiation to be had. And the last five, 10 percent of negotiations are always very difficult to close out,\" he said.\\n\\n\\t\"For me, the view right now currently is not whether the (trade) deal gets done. It\\'s when the deal gets done ... It\\'s not if the deal will get completed, it\\'s when the deal will get completed,\" Gupta said.\\n\\n\\t\"I generally feel in a strategic context,\" he said. \"I think the negotiations are still well consolidated and will come to fruition at some point, sooner rather than later.\"\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x904ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x905ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x906ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/0605/c90000-9584593.html'}\n"

The State Council Information Office on Sunday issued a white paper to provide a comprehensive picture of the China-US economic and trade consultations, and present China\\'s policy position on these consultations. (Xinhua/Zhang Yuwei)\\n\\n\\tFull text: China\\'s Position on the China-US Economic and Trade Consultations\\n\\n\\tBEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China published a white paper Sunday denouncing U.S. unilateral and protectionist measures, criticizing its backtracking on Sino-U.S. trade talks, and demonstrating China\\'s stance on trade consultations and pursuit of reasonable solutions.\\n\\n\\tThe white paper, \"China\\'s Position on the China-U.S. Economic and Trade Consultations,\" was issued by the State Council Information Office.\\n\\n\\tBesides a preface and a conclusion, the 8,300-character white paper devotes three sections to elaborate on the damages of the trade frictions provoked by the United States, the U.S. backtracking on its commitment in the consultations, and China\\'s commitment to credible consultations based on equality and mutual benefit.\\n\\n\\tTRADE WAR DETRIMENTAL TO BOTH COUNTRIES AND WORLD\\n\\n\\tThe white paper said that the Chinese and American economies were highly integrated and together constituted an entire industrial chain in today\\'s globalized world.\\n\\n\\tThe two economies are bound in a union that is mutually beneficial and win-win in nature, therefore equating a trade deficit to being taken advantages of is an error.\\n\\n\\t\"The restrictive measures the U.S. has imposed on China are not good for China or the U.S., and still worse for the rest of the world,\" the white paper said.\\n\\n\\tThe U.S. tariff measures led to a decrease in the volume of China\\'s exports to the United States, which fell by 9.7 percent year-on-year in the first four months of 2019, dropping for five months in a row. As China has to impose tariffs as a countermeasure to U.S. tariff hikes, U.S. exports to China have dropped for eight months in a row.\\n\\n\\tThe uncertainty brought by U.S.-China economic and trade friction made companies in both countries more hesitant about investing. China\\'s investment in the U.S. continued to fall and the growth rate of U.S. investment in China has also slowed.\\n\\n\\tInstead of boosting American economic growth, the U.S. tariff measures have significantly increased production costs for U.S. companies, pushed up domestic prices and undermined American people\\'s livelihoods.\\n\\n\\tThe U.S. protectionist measures also damaged the multilateral trading system, seriously disrupted global industrial chains and supply chains, undermined market confidence, and posed a serious challenge to global economic recovery and are a major threat to the trend of economic globalization, the white paper said.\\n\\n\\tWith the outlook for China-U.S. trade friction unclear, the WTO has lowered its forecast for global trade growth in 2019 from 3.7 percent to 2.6 percent.\\n\\n\\tU.S. REPEATED BACKTRACKING LEADS TO TRADE TALK SETBACKS\\n\\n\\tChina had advocated resolving economic and trade friction through negotiation and consultation from the start. However, the U.S. administration kept changing its demands in the previous negotiations.\\n\\n\\tSetbacks in the consultations were all results of \"U.S. breach of consensus and commitments, and backtracking,\" the white paper said.\\n\\n\\tAt a press conference in Beijing Sunday, Chinese vice commerce minister Wang Shouwen denied U.S. accusations that China backtracked on its position in trade talks, underscoring that China has demonstrated the greatest sincerity and a strong sense of responsibility for resolving trade disputes through dialogue.\\n\\n\\tIt\\'s irresponsible to accuse China of backtracking, Wang said, \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\"\\n\\n\\tHistorical experience has proved that any attempt to force a deal through tactics such as smears, undermining and maximum pressure, will only spoil the cooperative relationship. Historic opportunities will be missed, the white paper said.\\n\\n\\tIt stressed that trade deals must be equal and mutually beneficial, and China will never compromise on major principles concerning China\\'s core interests.\\n\\n\\tOne prerequisite for a trade deal is that the U.S. should remove all additional tariffs imposed on Chinese exports and China\\'s purchase of U.S. goods should be realistic while ensuring that a proper balance in the text of the agreement is achieved to serve the common interests of both sides, according to the white paper.\\n\\n\\tCALLING FOR CONSULTATIONS BASED ON EQUALITY, MUTUAL BENEFIT\\n\\n\\tAs the two largest economies and trading nations in the world, it is only natural that China and the U.S. will experience some differences over trade and economic cooperation, the white paper said. \"What truly matters is how to enhance mutual trust, promote cooperation and manage differences.\"\\n\\n\\tMutual respect means that each should respect the other\\'s social system, economic system, development path and rights, core interests, and major concerns. It also means that one side should not cross the other\\'s \"red lines\". The right to development cannot be sacrificed, still the less can sovereignty be undermined, according to the white paper.\\n\\n\\tAs for equality and mutual benefit, the two sides in the consultations should operate on an equal footing, and results should be mutually beneficial. \"Negotiations will get nowhere if one side tries to coerce the other or if only one party will benefit from the outcomes,\" the white paper said.\\n\\n\\tWang Shouwen said China was willing to settle trade friction through cooperation to achieve a win-win agreement, while stressing that China will not give ground on issues of principle.\\n\\n\\tWang called on the United States to meet China half way, uphold the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and jointly promote the stable and healthy development of bilateral economic and trade relations.\\n\\n\\t\"If any agreement is reached, it should be based on equality and mutual benefit,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tChina remains committed to its own cause no matter how the external environment changes. The fundamental solution to economic and trade tensions is to grow stronger through reform and opening up.\\n\\n\\tWith the enormous demand from the domestic market, deeper supply-side structural reform will comprehensively increase the competitiveness of Chinese products and companies, the white paper said.\\n\\n\\tBesides, the country still has sufficient room for fiscal and monetary policy maneuvers, so it can maintain sound momentum for sustainable and healthy economic development, the white paper added.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/0603/c90000-9583930.html'}\n",

Bill Pellett knows how to farm, but just like most of his peers across the country, the 71-year-old farmer is feeling less assured of what he could get from a new year of farming, as there appears to be no quick resolution of the year-long trade disputes between the United States and China. (Xinhua/Wang Ying)\\n\\n\\tDES MOINES, the United States, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Bill Pellett knows how to farm, but just like most of his peers across the country, the 71-year-old farmer is feeling less assured of what he could get from a new year of farming, as there appears to be no quick resolution of the year-long trade disputes between the United States and China.\\n\\n\\tA fifth-generation farmer, Pellett has been producing corn, soybeans and beef at his 6,000-acre family farm for most of his life in Atlantic, a small city in the U.S. state of Iowa, which is often dubbed \"America\\'s granary.\"\\n\\n\\t\"We definitely suffered some loss from the trade problems,\" said Pellett while working on one of his corn fields in late April, the beginning of a new crop season.\\n\\n\\tLast summer, the United States imposed additional tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese imports. China immediately retaliated, with tariffs that hit American agricultural products the most.\\n\\n\\tAccording to Pellett, the prices of soybeans have fallen by 10 to 15 percent mainly due to reduced exports to China, a major market for American soybeans before bilateral trade relations stalled.\\n\\n\\tPellett\\'s family produces 768,000 bushels of corn and 190,000 bushels of soybeans annually. But a bumper harvest could mean further losses under current circumstances.\\n\\n\\t\"There\\'s a lot of excess production of soybeans right now. The surplus seems to be growing on the soybeans instead of diminishing,\" said the seasoned farmer.\\n\\n\\tPellett also raises nearly 2,000 head of cattle. In January 2018, he took a business trip to China for the first time to promote his beef there, as American beef just returned to the Chinese market after a 14-year ban due to the mad cow disease outbreak.\\n\\n\\tDuring the week-long trip, Pellett was stunned by the Great Wall, as well as a ride on the high-speed rail. Everything he saw made him more determined to bring more of his products to the Chinese market. But the onset of the trade war made his ambitions hard to realize, at least for now.\\n\\n\\t\"The trade friction between the two countries has been building for a long time and it needs to be solved,\" said Pellett.\\n\\n\\tFor Grant Kimberley, marketing director of the Iowa Soybean Association, the sharp contrast in export statistics before and after the trade conflicts is really alarming and frustrating.\\n\\n\\tPrior to the trade stand-off, \"about one third of all the soybeans grown in the United States were destined for China,\" while Iowa is the country\\'s second biggest soybean producing state, said Kimberley, who himself is a sixth-generation soybean farmer with a family farm near Des Moines, the state capital.\\n\\n\\tKimberley told Xinhua that U.S. soybean exports to China saw a sharp decline over the past year, and about half of the supplies that would normally have gone to China now went to somewhere else, with farmers still at a deficit for net total exports.\\n\\n\\tThe further escalation of trade tensions earlier this month, with Washington raising additional tariffs on 200 billion U.S. dollars of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent, dampened Kimberley\\'s hope for some quick, positive changes.\\n\\n\\t\"With prices going lower and soybean supplies growing -- and with only modest hope that a resolution is near -- we\\'re likely to be mired in this scenario for some time,\" he added. \"For some farmers, the crop they\\'re currently planting may be their last.\"\\n\\n\\tAccording to Mike Naig, Iowa\\'s secretary of Agriculture, the agriculture sector is \"a significant economic driver\" for the state, which helps create one in five local jobs and contributes some 25 percent of the local GDP.\\n\\n\\tAs exports are \"really a big part of what makes Iowa agriculture work,\" the disruptions and uncertainty triggered by the trade disputes would hurt farmers and their products\\' market, Naig told Xinhua during a recent interview.\\n\\n\\tChina has \"rising standards of living and an increasing middle class that is bigger than the entire U.S. population,\" which provides great business opportunities for American and Iowan farmers who \"strive to be a consistent quality supplier,\" the secretary elaborated.\\n\\n\\tApart from soybeans and meat, some value-added products of corn, such as dried distillers\\' grains as livestock feed, and ethanol as clean fuel, have also become new hot sells from the state to China, he noted.\\n\\n\\tCalling the trade relationship between the United States and China a \"valuable one,\" the secretary stressed, \"We don\\'t want to damage relationships that we\\'ve all established over these many years.\"\\n\\n\\t\"You have to work together to get to know each other and establish business relationships and supply chains, and to disrupt that -- that\\'s very difficult and unfortunate,\" he added.\\n\\n\\tSpeaking of the current situation, the secretary said, \"we are anxious to see this all resolved and get to a place where we can start doing business again -- not just like we were, but even better.\"\\n\\n\\tHe was echoed by Pellett the farmer, who repeatedly told Xinhua that he still \"has faith\" in the two nations\\' agreement to a final deal that is good for both.\\n\\n\\tBut if things continue to turn for the worse, \"I will cut cost, reduce production, and tighten the belt,\" said Pellett.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x904ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x905ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x906ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x907ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x908ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x909ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x9010ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x9011ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x9012ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x9013ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/0524/c90000-9581071.html'}\n",

Two years later, the Communist Party of China (CPC) was founded.\\n\\n\\tThe May Fourth Movement is widely considered a great patriotic and revolutionary campaign pioneered by advanced young intellectuals and joined by people from all walks of life to resolutely fight imperialism and feudalism.\\n\\n\\tAttending a gathering earlier this week to mark the movement\\'s centenary, President Xi Jinping said the movement inspired the ambition and confidence of the Chinese people and nation to realize national rejuvenation.\\n\\n\\tXi, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, said young people always play a vanguard role in realizing national rejuvenation, which is the mission of the Chinese youth in the new era.\\n\\n\\tHe called on the younger generation to bear their responsibilities of the times and carry on the May Fourth spirit centered on patriotism, progress, democracy and science.\\n\\n\\tBUSY AS BEES\\n\\n\\tChai Shanshan is a young man who faces hardship head-on.\\n\\n\\tComing to work in Shanghai more than a decade ago, Chai started his career as a luggage handler at train stations.\\n\\n\\tHe toiled under the scorching sun and in the freezing cold.

(Xinhua/Zhang Ruoxuan)\\n\\n\\tBEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Amid a surging trend toward global interconnectivity propelled by the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), noises pop up from time to time as to how this grand vision of the BRI may have its bearing on the world.\\n\\n\\tThe Belt and Road, referring to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiated by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, aims to build trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe and Africa and beyond the ancient Silk Road routes.\\n\\n\\tEyeing high-quality cooperation in boosting common prosperity, the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation is due to be held from April 25 to 27 in Beijing. Some 5,000 participants from more than 150 countries and 90 international organizations have confirmed their attendance.\\n\\n\\tFacts have come to show that the BRI is a peaceful, open and green road of win-win cooperation, as well as a revitalized historical route leading to a community with a shared future for humanity.\\n\\n\\tDEBT TRAP VS. DEVELOPMENT DIVIDEND\\n\\n\\t\"Debt trap diplomacy\" has been a big buy for those with Cold War mindset, demonizing China\\'s loans as \"creating economic dependency on Beijing.\" Facts show, however, that the BRI is helping lift countries out of a \"trap of no development\" rather than duping them into a \"debt trap.\"\\n\\n\\tTo start with, developing countries in the stage of economic take-off, especially those in Asia and Africa, are in urgent need of capital for infrastructure investment. What China has done is to extend a helping hand to such programs, based on the principle of \"mutual respect, justice and fairness, and win-win results.\"\\n\\n\\tIn terms of project selection as well as investment and financing cooperation under the BRI, all concerned parties will make decisions prudently after joint consultation, risk assessment and feasibility studies.\\n\\n\\t\"For those with difficulty in debt repayment, China seeks proper settlement via friendly consultation, and never coerces them into repaying the debt,\" said Yang Jiechi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.\\n\\n\\tA further look at a country-specific debt portfolio reveals the lack of fairness of the debt-trap rhetoric.\\n\\n\\tFor instance, Sarmad Ali, managing director of Jang Media Group, the largest media group in Pakistan, said that the debt incurred by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the framework of regional connectivity under BRI cooperation, accounts for only around 6 percent of Pakistan\\'s total external debt and liabilities.\\n\\n\\tCPEC is not only a drive for development, but also injects huge amounts of capital into Pakistan, he added.\\n\\n\\tSome Western critics tend to blast China for \"intentionally creating\" the debt problem of Sri Lanka\\'s Hambantota port and its handover, but such allegations are no more than a fabrication out of thin air.\\n\\n\\tSri Lanka has \"limited experience\" in absorbing capital and management, and that\\'s why the country decided to cooperate with China Merchants Group in operation, Sri Lanka\\'s Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told the press recently.\\n\\n\\tFor better sustainability of infrastructure in B&R countries, which requires huge and high-stakes input and returns over a long time, China is quickening its pace to help BRI participants with auxiliary facilities and systematic development planning, to improve the external conditions for their economic prosperity.\\n\\n\\tBLACK-BOX OPERATIONS VS. A TRANSPARENT PLAN\\n\\n\\tWestern critics are inclined to use \"black-box operations\" to describe B&R cooperation, saying that China has an opaque system when it comes to initiative-related decision-making.\\n\\n\\tHowever, officials and experts say from notion to action, the BRI advocates and adheres to the principle of transparency and inclusiveness.\\n\\n\\t\"China has kicked off the initiative, but it is up to others to join and play the game together,\" said Ruan Zongze, executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies.\\n\\n\\tDirector-general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization Jose Graziano da Silva praised China for pursuing inclusiveness development with no one left behind, and Caroline Kennedy-Pipe, an expert on international security from Britain, believed no dangers were detected in Chinese investment and that B&R cooperation is transparent.\\n\\n\\tNothing could better exemplify the success of the initiative than the significant traction enjoyed by the BRI.\\n\\n\\tTo date, 126 countries and 29 international organizations have concluded BRI-related cooperation agreements with China, including Italy, a member of the Group of Seven.\\n\\n\\tThere is no single dominant party, but equal participants; no operations under the table, but openness and transparency; no \"winner taking it all,\" but mutual benefits and a win-win situation, said Wang Yiwei, a professor with Renmin University of China.\\n\\n\\tFurthermore, the projects under the Belt and Road framework are in line with the basic norms of international laws and regulations and abide by internationally accepted business logic and operational models.\\n\\n\\tJust as President Xi said, the BRI is \"a plan in the sunshine.\"\\n\\n\\tHEAVY POLLUTER VS. GREEN CHAMPION\\n\\n\\tIs China exporting \"surplus production capacity\" via the BRI, as doubted by some? Facts show the BRI is an epitome of a green champion rather than a diversion of pollution leading to \"environmental risks.\"\\n\\n\\t\"Green finance is becoming steadily more influential in the Belt and Road, and China is playing a prominent role in this trend,\" stated a Standard Chartered article about the BRI published on its website in 2018, expecting BRI to be the \"opportunities to serve the greater good.\"\\n\\n\\tIn line with China\\'s persistent endeavor to \"draw a redline\" on pollution control, enterprises are required to play a principal role in ecological governance and are encouraged to release annual reports on environmental performance in abiding by relevant laws and regulations in B&R countries, as laid down in a China-issued guidance on promoting green BRI.\\n\\n\\tAs a manifestation of nature-human harmony, Cambodia\\'s Sanghe II hydropower station, its largest hydropower project jointly developed with China, has set aside an artificial passageway for fish migration after careful environmental impact assessment, to avoid soil erosion and biodiversity degradation.\\n\\n\\tThe Ethiopia-China Joint Laboratory at the Ethiopian Leather Industry Development Institute, by the same token, gives effective treatment to tannery wastewater, a successful marriage of sound economic payback and ecological sustainability.\\n\\n\\t\"China\\'s experience in renewable energy technology application can also be replicated via BRI cooperation in the Middle East, Africa and other regions, to inspire green development paradigms,\" said Erik Solheim, former executive director of United Nations Environment Programme.\\n\\n\\tGEOPOLITICAL STRATEGY VS. GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS\\n\\n\\tWith its growing popularity, the BRI is blamed by some with ulterior motives as one of China\\'s instruments in its geopolitical conflicts with other major countries.\\n\\n\\tIn fact, as one of the most well-known international public goods and platforms for global cooperation, the initiative aims to achieve common prosperity rather than boost the so-called \"Chinese clout.\"\\n\\n\\t\"China does not have a clique of allies to cajole or enemies to coerce. The Belt and Road construction is aimed at achieving the common development of all countries rather than seeking spheres of political influence,\" said Wang Yiwei.\\n\\n\\tHe said the BRI is not like Marshall Plan, and China is not trying to buy friends. \"No political conditions have been imposed on participants in the initiative, nor is it ideologically oriented,\" Wang added.\\n\\n\\tIt should be noted that many countries and regions actively dovetailed the BRI with their own development plans, ranging from the EU\\'s Junker Investment Plan to the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity, the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union, Turkey\\'s Middle Corridor projects, and Kazakhstan\\'s Bright Path.\\n\\n\\tBRI-related investments can lift up to 34 million people from moderate poverty with respect to the baseline, among whom 29.4 million are from countries and regions along the BRI route, according to a recent World Bank report.\\n\\n\\tThanks to the accelerated Belt and Road cooperation, the Maldives had its first inter-island bridge, Belarus was enabled to produce passenger vehicles, and the landlocked Kazakhstan was connected to the Pacific Ocean via the logistics base in China\\'s Lianyungang city.\\n\\n\\tChangyong Rhee, director of the International Monetary Fund Asia and Pacific Department, believed the BRI has benefited the world in fostering infrastructure need in the low-income countries and also promoting regional cooperation and connectivity in trade investment, human mobility and finance.\\n\\n\\tIt is a \"very important contribution\" to the global economy, Rhee said.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x904ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x905ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x906ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/0425/c90000-9571744.html'}\n"

(Xinhua/Wang Peng)\\n\\n\\tBEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China on Friday elaborated its foreign policy championing peace, development, cooperation and multilateralism, providing certainty to a world full of uncertainties.\\n\\n\\tAt a press conference, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China will continue to follow a peaceful development path, uphold the existing international system, favor cooperation over confrontation while shouldering more responsibilities, as the country moves r to the world\\'s center stage.\\n\\n\\tThe press conference, held on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People\\'s Congress, is regarded as a once-a-year opportunity to take a thorough look at China\\'s foreign policy and understand its views of the world affairs.\\n\\n\\t\"China\\'s diplomacy has reached a new starting point,\" Wang said. \"China will surely become stronger but not assertive; China values independence but will not go forward alone; China stands up for its rights but never seeks hegemony.\"\\n\\n\\tCOOPERATE TO GAIN\\n\\n\\tWang said the fundamental guideline for China\\'s diplomatic work in the new era is Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, which points the way for navigating through a complex array of issues in today\\'s world.\\n\\n\\t\"A key part of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy is developing a new path of state-to-state relations featuring dialogue instead of confrontation, partnership instead of alliance,\" said Ruan Zongze, executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies.\\n\\n\\tUnder the spotlight are China-U.S. relations, as some fear a looming Thucydides Trap, which warns of cataclysmic war between a rising power and an established one.\\n\\n\\tNoting that competition is normal, Wang said exaggerating competition would reduce the space of cooperation.\\n\\n\\t\"China and the United States stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation,\" the state councilor said.\\n\\n\\tThe interests of the two countries are indeed inseparable. Bilateral trade surpassed 630 billion U.S. dollars last year, with cumulative bilateral investment reaching 240 billion dollars.\\n\\n\\tWang noted the substantial progress made in the ongoing economic and trade consultations.\\n\\n\\t\"We still have a positive outlook on China-U.S. relations. The two countries will not, and should not descend into confrontation,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tXu Xiujun, a research fellow with the Institute of World Economy and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said cooperation remains the main theme of China-U.S. ties. \"China and the United States will not engage in a cold war.\"\\n\\n\\tA good example of major-country interaction is demonstrated by China and Russia.\\n\\n\\tAs China and Russia mark the 70th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties in 2019, leaders of the two countries are expected to exchange visits, the state councilor said.\\n\\n\\t\"When China and Russia stand together, the world will be a safer and more peaceful and stable place,\" Wang said.\\n\\n\\tThe state councilor said China\\'s traditional friendship with the Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea (DPRK) is brimming with vitality and its ties with Japan is improving. He also expressed hope for friendship and cooperation between China and India to surge ahead \"like the Yangtze and the Ganges.\"\\n\\n\\tPEACE, BUT NO \"SILENT LAMBS\"\\n\\n\\tResponding to a question on the recent tension between Pakistan and India, Wang reiterated China\\'s call for calm and restraint. Disagreement should be settled by goodwill, he said.\\n\\n\\tWang applauded the recent DPRK-U.S. summit, describing it as an important step toward a political settlement of the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.\\n\\n\\tWhile acknowledging that it\\'s impossible to solve the issue overnight, Wang said the concerned parties should not be \"a prisoner of history,\" urging them to break the cycle of mistrust and together work out a general roadmap for achieving denuclearization and a peace mechanism on the peninsula.\\n\\n\\tWang took note of the stabilized and improving situation in the South China Sea, appealed to all parties in Afghanistan to \"push open the door to peace,\" and warned against \"historical lessons\" being repeated in Venezuela under external interference and sanctions.\\n\\n\\t\"Upholding peace and development is the \\'secret to success\\' of China\\'s diplomacy and a great contribution China makes to the world,\" Ruan said.\\n\\n\\tWang also made it clear that China will firmly protect its legitimate rights and interests.\\n\\n\\tAnswering a question regarding recent action against the Chinese tech company Huawei and its CFO, Wang said China supports relevant company and individual seeking legal redress and choosing not to be \"silent lambs\".\\n\\n\\tWang said it was not a pure judicial case, but a \"deliberate political move,\" adding that China has taken and will continue to take all necessary measures to resolutely protect the legitimate interests of Chinese firms and citizens.\\n\\n\\t\"PASSENGERS IN SAME BOAT\"\\n\\n\\tA centerpiece of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy is to build a community with a shared future for humanity, experts said.

Europe, Wang said, is also against unilateralism and protectionism.\\n\\n\\tPresident Xi will visit Europe on his first overseas trip this year, which speaks volumes about China\\'s support for Europe, Wang said.\\n\\n\\tOn other continents, Wang said relations between China and Latin American countries have gained great progress, while China-Africa cooperation has grown into a towering tree that no force can topple.\\n\\n\\tThe state councilor said China will fully implement the eight major initiatives announced at the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and continuously deepen Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation.\\n\\n\\tThe BRI, proposed by Xi in 2013, has brought countries and regions together through enhanced trade, infrastructure development, investment, cultural and people-to-people exchanges.

China-US relations was one of the hot topics at the press conference and one particular concern was whether China and the United States are moving toward conflict and, if so, how to avoid this tragedy.\\n\\n\\tIn response, Wang said that the China-US relationship has always been a mix of cooperation and friction, but that the cooperation outweighs the friction. He acknowledged the fact that the two countries are facing serious challenges, but also pointed out that a look back at history shows that heightened tension does not represent the general trend of China-US relations. He said that China still holds positive expectations for the future of China-US relations and believes that the two countries should not and will not descend into confrontation.\\n\\n\\tHis comments serve as a powerful reminder that, when assessing the future of China-US relations, it is important to look at the facts and bid adieu to the old thinking that China-US relations are destined to develop into a â\\x80\\x9cnew Cold War.â\\x80\\x9d For example, Wang pointed out that the interests of China and the United States are highly integrated. In 2018, trade volume between the two countries exceeded $630 billion and two-way investment surpassed $240 billion. In addition, almost all major US companies have operations in China and that almost all US states have cooperation with China.\\n\\n\\tSome individuals vow to decouple the US economy from China. However, as Wang Yi pointed out, this is just their wishful thinking. â\\x80\\x9cDecoupling from China would mean decoupling from opportunities, from the future, and in a sense, even from the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\tThe point being is that while the relationship is rocky at the moment, there is no new era of â\\x80\\x9cdecoupling,â\\x80\\x9d and the China-US relationship is not fated for rivalry. Just from the basic data cited by Wang at the press conference, it is obvious that cooperation is still the general direction of China-US relations. There are many indicators, including the positive progress in China-US economic and trade consultations, pointing to the fact that both sides are committed to building a deep and enduring relationship.\\n\\n\\tThe China-US relationship has had its ups and downs in the past 40 years and there will almost certainly be more challenges to come. But one thing for sure, that is, the United States has much to gain from cooperation with China, and much to lose from confrontation with China. China and the United States must continue to work together, because cooperation is in the best interest of both sides as well as the world.\\n\\n\\tThere will always be some competition between China and the United States, as competition is a normal aspect of international relations. However, as Wang pointed out, the key is to put things in perspective. Blowing competition between the two sides out of proportion will only squeeze the space for cooperation. The right attitude is to focus on expanding China-US cooperation.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/0308/c90000-9554154.html'}\n",

Thanks to the high-level mutual trust and strategic guidance of the two heads of state, bilateral ties have always been as firm and stable as a rock or mountain, and are becoming a strategic force in maintaining world peace and stability. The stable China-Russia relations, which are grounded on continuously expanding common interests, never target a third party, and are never affected by third-party factors.\\n\\n\\tQ: There was an important turnover on the Korean Peninsula in 2018. What role did China play in this?\\n\\n\\tWang Yi: China always stays firmly committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and adheres to establishing a peace mechanism and solving issues through dialogue. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve taken efforts toward this for more than 20 years. This year, some positive changes have taken place on the peninsula.\\n\\n\\tIn the face of the hard-earned opportunity for peace, we encourage parties on the peninsula to conquer difficulties and further improve relations, until the situation on the peninsula is truly stabilized.\\n\\n\\tWe encourage the US and the DPRK to meet each other halfway and implement their commitments made in the joint statement inked in the Singapore meeting as soon as possible. At the same time, we are happy to see the situation of \"double suspension\" continue, and expect to promote parallel progress in the denuclearization of the peninsula and the establishment of a peace mechanism, which will take care of the concerns of all parties. It is the fundamental policy to promote long-term peace and stability of the peninsula.\\n\\n\\tQ: This year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up.

Ltd, a private integrated R&D service company.\\n\\n\\tBarker\\'s former army fellows once doubted why he chose to work in China.\\n\\n\\tChina is full of hopes and opportunities and Chinese people are optimistic and kind, said Barker, adding that China was no threat to the West and the world.\\n\\n\\tBarker has persuaded his son, who is studying computer engineering in Nevada, to work in China after graduation.\\n\\n\\tBarker\\'s life experiences coincided with key events of China\\'s reform and opening-up. He joined the army in 1984 when former U.S. president Ronald Reagan visited China, retired from army in 1997 when the Asian financial crisis broke out and began his China endeavor in 2008 when the international financial crisis erupted.\\n\\n\\tChina\\'s reform and opening-up that began in 1978 has not only changed China but also deeply affected the world and reshaped its relations with the world.\\n\\n\\tINTEGRATION\\n\\n\\tChina was to a large extent isolated with the world until the late 1970s and early 1980s when it changed the war-inevitable mentality and established peace and development as the two major themes of the present times.\\n\\n\\tBarker still remembered the scenes when the Reagans visited the Great Wall in 1984.\\n\\n\\t\"Everything seemed to be that peaceful and beautiful,\" Barker said.\\n\\n\\tSince the reform and opening-up, China has been integrating with the world and is walking to the center of global stage.\\n\\n\\tChina is already the world\\'s second biggest economy and the world\\'s largest trading nation. It is also the world\\'s biggest source of international students and the world\\'s largest group of outbound tourists.\\n\\n\\tFacing mounting protectionism and a stagnant world economy, China has proposed a new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation and following the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration in engaging in global governance.\\n\\n\\tA median of 70 percent of respondents across 25 countries say China plays a more important global role than it did a decade ago, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of 25 nations that was released in October.\\n\\n\\tCONTRIBUTOR\\n\\n\\tThe second year after the 2008 global financial crisis broke out, Barker moved to Suzhou and realized the great contribution China had made.\\n\\n\\tThe country has helped stabilize the global economy during the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis.\\n\\n\\tHe said that without China\\'s contribution, the global economy would have struggled in the abyss for a longer time.\\n\\n\\tChina has driven global growth over the past 40 years. Its GDP has averaged an annual growth of around 9.5 percent.\\n\\n\\tThe country\\'s foreign trade has also registered an annual growth of 14.5 percent in U.S. dollar terms.

China believes that development and security should be attached equal importance so as to maintain long-term peace.\\n\\n\\tChina is the second largest investor in UN peacekeeping operations, and has sent the most peace-keeping forces among the permanent members of the UN Security Council. It has been actively involved in the world\\'s peace-keeping campaigns including efforts in the most dangerous countries and regions.\\n\\n\\tChina has also announced that it would be part of the UN capability readiness system, a global peace-keeping mechanism that will provide quick responses to activities in breach of world and regional peace, with a permanent peacekeeping force of 8,000 troops.\\n\\n\\tGUARDIAN OF GLOBAL ORDER\\n\\n\\tLin Huiping, 37, could be categorized as one of China\\'s \"post reform and opening-up generation.\" A professor at Soochow University, she acts as an advisor to the university\\'s mock UN activities.\\n\\n\\tIn the latest session she oversaw, the students of the university played the roles of country representatives at the UN General Assembly and debated peacekeeping missions in Africa.\\n\\n\\t\"In the simulation of the UN session, the students had a taste of democracy and multinationalism in international relations, and had a better understanding of what the \\'community with a shared future for mankind\\' means,\" Liu said.\\n\\n\\tMock UN activities, now common in Chinese universities and even high schools, demonstrate the younger Chinese\\'s growing wish of participating in global affairs against the backdrop of an ever opening China.\\n\\n\\tThis is in line with China\\'s new role as a guardian of multinationalism.

A delayed parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal will take place on Jan. 15, 2019. (Xinhua/Tim Ireland)\\n\\n\\tLONDON, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Theresa May said Monday she will make the closing speech drawing to a close the marathon debate on Britain\\'s future in the European Union (EU).\\n\\n\\tDespite making a strong plea to MPs to support her Brexit deal, few people across the political divide expect May to win enough support when more than 640 Westminster MPs vote on Tuesday evening.\\n\\n\\tIf, as widely expected, May loses Tuesday\\'s vote, she will live to fight another day. She will have until next Monday to return to the House of Commons with an alternative plan.\\n\\n\\tWaiting in the wings will be the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has announced he will trigger a vote of no confidence in May\\'s government if she loses the vote. But he has yet to say when he would actually start the process.\\n\\n\\tCorbyn met Monday night with Labour MPs at Westminster and assured them that a no-confidence vote \"would be coming soon\".\\n\\n\\tThe main opposition Labour party hope a confidence vote will trigger a snap general election, and the chance for a new Labour government to seek a better Brexit deal with the EU.\\n\\n\\tCorbyn said: \"When the prime minister\\'s deal is defeated, she will only have herself to blame. She has spent two years negotiating with her cabinet and her bickering backbenchers instead of the EU, shutting out trade unions, businesses and parliament from the process.\\n\\n\\t\"The Tory party\\'s botched deal will be rejected by parliament. We will then need an election to have the chance to vote for a government that can bring our people together and address the deep-seated issues facing our country.\"\\n\\n\\tA rally to see off a confidence vote could see Conservative MPs, bolstered by the Democratic Unionist Party, oppose Corbyn\\'s move to prevent a general election.

She has insisted the March deadline will remain.\\n\\n\\tOpening the penultimate day of the Brexit debate Monday, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox described the 2016 EU referendum as a contract with the British people. He said the contract needed to be honored.\\n\\n\\tHe told MPs in the House of Commons: \"For parliament to attempt in any way to thwart or block Brexit by any means would be an act of vanity and self indulgence that would create a breach of trust between parliament and the people, with potentially unknowable consequences.\"\\n\\n\\tFox said 80 percent of the MPs members were elected on a manifesto that said they would honor the result of the referendum.\\n\\n\\t\"We have a duty to do so if we are to keep faith with our voters,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tHundreds of journalists from the world\\'s media have descended on Westminster, creating a media village, to report on one of the biggest political events since the end of World War II.\\n\\n\\tOne political commentator said: \"The future of Britain in the EU goes well beyond the borders of Europe, it is a world event, with global implications.\"\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x904ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x905ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x906ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x907ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/0115/c90000-9537817.html'}\n"

Thanks to the high-level mutual trust and strategic guidance of the two heads of state, bilateral ties have always been as firm and stable as a rock or mountain, and are becoming a strategic force in maintaining world peace and stability. The stable China-Russia relations, which are grounded on continuously expanding common interests, never target a third party, and are never affected by third-party factors.\\n\\n\\tQ: There was an important turnover on the Korean Peninsula in 2018. What role did China play in this?\\n\\n\\tWang Yi: China always stays firmly committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and adheres to establishing a peace mechanism and solving issues through dialogue. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve taken efforts toward this for more than 20 years. This year, some positive changes have taken place on the peninsula.\\n\\n\\tIn the face of the hard-earned opportunity for peace, we encourage parties on the peninsula to conquer difficulties and further improve relations, until the situation on the peninsula is truly stabilized.\\n\\n\\tWe encourage the US and the DPRK to meet each other halfway and implement their commitments made in the joint statement inked in the Singapore meeting as soon as possible. At the same time, we are happy to see the situation of \"double suspension\" continue, and expect to promote parallel progress in the denuclearization of the peninsula and the establishment of a peace mechanism, which will take care of the concerns of all parties. It is the fundamental policy to promote long-term peace and stability of the peninsula.\\n\\n\\tQ: This year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. In terms of diplomacy, what is the significance and global influence of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s reform and opening up?\\n\\n\\tWang Yi: Forty years ago, reform and opening-up changed China fundamentally, opening a door for the countryâ\\x80\\x99s communication with the rest of the world.\\n\\n\\tChinaâ\\x80\\x99s reform and opening-up has witnessed the most remarkable achievements during the six years since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi as its core, has launched a series of important measures, making a number of historical achievements.\\n\\n\\tI believe that following Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s continuing reform and opening-up, the country will surely inject even greater vitality into the world over the next 40 years, bringing endurable peace, as well as providing the world with more positivity.\\n\\n\\tã\\x80\\x80', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/0103/c90000-9534466.html'}\n"

(Xinhua/Lehtikuva/Heikki Saukkomaa)\\n\\n\\tBERLIN, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty has triggered worries that it may cause a new round of arms race between Washington and Moscow.\\n\\n\\tEuropean countries, situated between the Atlantic and Russia, have the most vested interests in the treaty, the most significant achievement of arms control in the Cold War era.\\n\\n\\tExperts believe that the possible invalidation of the treaty will be a big blow to the United States\\' European allies, as well as the already poisoned transatlantic relations.\\n\\n\\tEXTREME WORRIES ACROSS EUROPE\\n\\n\\tAfter U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed last month that the United States will terminate the INF Treaty and pull out of it, shocked European officials responded quickly.\\n\\n\\tThe German government issued a statement saying that it will do its utmost to preserve the treaty. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told media that as the treaty concerns the vital interests of Europe, Germany will fight for it with all diplomatic approaches, including influencing Russia and putting the issue on top of NATO\\'s agenda.\\n\\n\\tThe signing of the INF Treaty and the withdrawal of the mid-range missiles from Germany were among the greatest achievements of disarmament policy and are important for the European security architecture, said Maas.\\n\\n\\tThe 1987 agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union prohibited the construction and possession of land-based, nuclear-armed missiles or cruise missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 km.\\n\\n\\tHaving kept nuclear missiles out of Europe for three decades, the INF Treaty is facing challenges in recent years, as the United States and Russia accuse each other of violating the agreement.\\n\\n\\tFrance, another major country in the European Union (EU) and a member of the nuclear club, responded with a warning by its Foreign Ministry that \"hasty\" and \"unilateral\" decision on the INF Treaty would be \"regrettable.\"\\n\\n\\tFrench President Emmanuel Macron told Trump about the importance of the treaty especially in regard to European security.\\n\\n\\tEuropean Commission Spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said the treaty, one of the cornerstones of the European security structure, contributed to the end of the Cold War and the nuclear arms race. She urged the United States and Russia to remain engaged in dialogue.\\n\\n\\tEUROPE FALLS VICTIM\\n\\n\\tSituated between the United States and Russia and serving as a buffer zone for the two superpowers in the Cold War, European countries were the major beneficiaries of the INF Treaty and will bear the brunt of the consequences of U.S. withdrawal.\\n\\n\\tChristian Moelling, deputy director of the research institute of Berlin-based German Council on Foreign Relations, said in a recent article that the withdrawal will accelerate the dismantling of German and European security order. Without the treaty, Europe would soon be threatened by Russian nuclear weapons without restriction.\\n\\n\\tThe weapon systems prohibited by the INF Treaty have a short flying time of a few minutes to the rival\\'s targets in Europe, which increases the risk of a nuclear war, Moelling wrote.\\n\\n\\tThe INF Treaty removed medium and short-range missiles deployed in Europe during the heyday of the Cold War, including cruise missiles from Britain, and U.S.-made Pershing missiles from Germany, and Soviet\\'s SS-20 missiles from East Europe.\\n\\n\\tKate Hudson, general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said the withdrawal from the treaty will open the way for the return of cruise-type missiles to Europe and an increased risk of a nuclear war on the European continent.\\n\\n\\tOliver Meier, an expert with Berlin-based German Institute for International and Security Affairs, estimated the invalidation of the treaty will trigger an arms race in Europe.\\n\\n\\t\"We are not prepared for a new arms race,\" said Maas, German foreign minister.\\n\\n\\tANOTHER BLOW TO TRANSATLANTIC TIES\\n\\n\\tExperts believe that the U.S. self-determined withdrawal from the INF Treaty has made the transatlantic relations worse.\\n\\n\\t\"They (Europeans) are particularly affected by the end of the treaty, but they were only informed by Washington, not consulted,\" said Meier.\\n\\n\\tThe United States made the decision without consulting European countries, the U.S. allies in NATO and the parties with the most vital interests in this issue.\\n\\n\\t\"If Trump is thinking to deploy missiles in Europe, this initiative will cause big problems with NATO while, on the other hand, if the U.S. gives a free hand to Russia to develop mid-range missiles because the treaty is over, Europe, like in the 1980s, could face serious challenges,\" said Stefano Silvestri, former Italian undersecretary of state for defense.\\n\\n\\t\"In both cases, this decision will put transatlantic relations in serious danger,\" said Silvestri.\\n\\n\\tAfter Trump\\'s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July, the United States made their Europeans allies feel uneasy as they were overlooked again.\\n\\n\\tThe transatlantic relations, one of the pillars of the EU\\'s foreign policy besides European integration, have been plunged into a difficult situation amid increasing distrust in recent years.\\n\\n\\tThe United States keeps accusing EU countries, especially Germany, of creating a huge U.S. trade deficit. Trump also complained that Europe does not assume its share of defense responsibility and has compelled European NATO allies to sharply increase defense budgets.\\n\\n\\tThe challenged transatlantic relations have made German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a sharp critic of Trump, call for grasping Europe\\'s destiny in its own hands, and Maas mull building a multilateral alliance.\\n\\n\\t\"An American withdrawal from the transatlantic security policy would destabilize Europe,\" said Moelling, adding that the withdrawal will also cause division within EU countries, a scenario that the bloc does not want to see.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tFile photo taken on Dec. 8, 1987 shows US president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signing the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in the White House in Washington D.C., the United States.

Also, economic delegation exchanged visits through the crossing.\\n\\n\\tState news agency SANA said the Syrian side entered truckloads of 21 tons of fruits as a gift to the economic delegations in Jordan and in return, the Jordanian side entered a truckload of dates to Syria.\\n\\n\\tAlso Monday, Syria has officially reopened the crossing between the southern province of Quneitra and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\\n\\n\\tThe Quneitra crossing was the only crossing for the Syrians in the Israel-occupied Golan Heights to enter Syria but not for the Syrians inside Syria as they are not allowed to enter the Israeli-occupied territory.\\n\\n\\tSyrian students from Golan Heights had used this crossing ahead of the Syrian crisis to study in Syria as the government has provided them with exceptional facilitations to seek education in their motherland.\\n\\n\\tAlso, marriages had taken place between Syrians in Golan and Quneitra in the past.\\n\\n\\tThere had been instances ahead of the Syrian war when apples harvested in Golan would be sold inside Syria through the crossing.\\n\\n\\tAs the crossing has been officially reopened, Golan students are expected to visit Syria through Quneitra after they had gone through long trips through Jordan to come to Syria by airplanes.\\n\\n\\tThe United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) has also returned to the disengagement zone after leaving it in 2014, as the separation line between the Bravo gate on the Syrian side and the Alpha gate on the Israeli side is an activity zone for the UNDOF.\\n\\n\\tThe rebels withdrew from Quneitra in July this year, after the Russians reached a deal with the Israeli side for restoring the situation in Quneitra to the pre-Syrian wartime and reviving the treaty of 1974 that ended the Yom Kippur war and designated the lines of separation between Israel and Syria.\\n\\n\\tKhaled Abaza, secretary of Syria\\'s Ba\\'ath Arab Socialist Party\\'s branch in Quneitra, told Xinhua that \"the reopening of this crossing is reviving the lifeline between our people who are under occupation and on their homeland.\"\\n\\n\\t\"This crossing is a lifeline for university students and also farmers who want to sell harvest and marketing it in Syria,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tMeanwhile, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem and the visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari said in a press conference Monday in Damascus that the border crossings between Iraq and Syria should be opened soon after the major defeat of the Islamic State (IS) in both countries.\\n\\n\\tAl-Jaafari said there is no reason not to open the border crossings between both countries, saying efforts are being exerted to reopen them as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\tFor his part, Muallem said that the terror groups were controlling the crossings, accusing the countries backing them of standing against the opening of the crossings.\\n\\n\\tHe also noted \"we hope that the crossing between the Syrian city of Abu Kamal and Iraq would be reopened soon.\"\\n\\n\\tBoth ministers did not say when the crossings will be reopened but said it should not take long.\\n\\n\\tExpectations for reopening the border points came as the Syrian army has cleared large swathes of border areas between Syria and Iraq from the presence of IS.\\n\\n\\tIn July, the Iraqi forces worked to enhance the security situation on the border with Syria, installing cameras and flying drones to ensure the security against any threat from IS.\\n\\n\\tThe border crossing that would be reopened is the al-Qa\\'im which is located in the southeast of Syria\\'s eastern province of Deir al-Zour in the city of Abu Kamal.\\n\\n\\tAl-Qa\\'im crossing is considered as one of the major supply routes across the Middle East, which connects the town of Abu Kamal in Syria\\'s Deir al-Zour to the city of Husaybah in the Al-Qa\\'im District of Iraq\\'s Anbar Governorate.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/1016/c90000-9508618.html'}\n"

As U.S. exports decline and imports increase, the U.S. trade deficit will increase further.\\n\\n\\tThe planned fiscal stimulus, large tax cuts and increased government spending will also temporarily boost domestic demand and imports, leading to a higher U.S. trade deficit, said Obstfeld, one of the world\\'s leading experts on international economics.\\n\\n\\tTherefore, \"trade policies don\\'t have major quantitatively measurable impact on current account imbalances, which are mainly a macroeconomic phenomenon,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tBased on current fiscal measures, the IMF estimated that the U.S. current account deficit, which is mainly made up of the trade deficit, would rise to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020 from 2.4 percent in 2017.\\n\\n\\t\"If there were a further tax cut, that number would rise even further, perhaps 4 percent of GDP or beyond,\" Obstfeld said.\\n\\n\\tAs the United States has an overall current account deficit, it\\'s natural that the country tends to have bilateral trade deficits with a number of trading partners.\\n\\n\\tBut these bilateral trade deficits don\\'t indicate that other trading partners cheat the United States on trade or it loses from trade, said Obstfeld.\\n\\n\\t\"On the contrary, the bilateral balances are a critical part of how the U.S. actually gains from trade,\" he argued, citing examples that imports of aluminum could end up being built into U.S. aircraft that are exported all over the world.\\n\\n\\t\"One of the big ways all countries gained from trade is from a more efficient international division of labor, where each country does what it does relatively best,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tTRADE, NOT ZERO-SUM GAME\\n\\n\\tObstfeld, who will retire from the IMF at the end of December and return to the University of California, Berkeley, firmly believes that international trade is a \"positive-sum game.\"\\n\\n\\t\"If you treat it as a zero-sum game, you may end up with a negative-sum game and the kind of risks of a trade war that we\\'re seeing today,\" he said, warning that severe trade restrictions would adversely affect productivity, investment and confidence.\\n\\n\\t\"I think countries should really step back and think about what their goals are and negotiate on a multilateral basis,\" said the IMF chief economist, calling for strengthening the World Trade Organization (WTO) and rules-based multilateral trading system.\\n\\n\\tIf current trade disputes are not resolved peacefully, U.S. stock markets and business investment will eventually \"adjust downward and we will see stronger negative effects,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tNO FURTHER FISCAL STIMULUS NEEDED\\n\\n\\tWhile Republicans in the House of Representatives are working with the government on another round of tax cuts before the mid-term elections, Obstfeld sees no need for further fiscal stimulus.\\n\\n\\t\"The U.S. is at or maybe even beyond the full employment point and there\\'s no need for further fiscal stimulus. In fact, we would like to see the U.S. going to the opposite direction,\" he said.\\n\\n\\t\"It should really think about rebuilding fiscal buffers and having those in place so that it can act when the next recession comes,\" Obstfeld said, adding the United States needs \"a stronger long-term fiscal position\" in the face of an aging population.\\n\\n\\tAn additional round of tax cuts would widen the U.S. current account deficit, \"possibly stoking more trade tensions\" and leading the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly, he said.\\n\\n\\t\"We know that eventually there will be another economic slowdown and at that point fiscal stimulus may be appropriate, but that would even increase the debt further,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tFederal debt could grow to double the size of the U.S. economy in 30 years if Congress extends tax cuts and continues the recently enacted spending increases, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released on Wednesday.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/0811/c90000-9489827.html'}\n",

      "496,{'發稿日': ['July18', '2018'], '新聞標題': 'Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s trade bullying tactics will hurt the US', '作者': \"People's Daily Online\", '新聞內文': 'On July 6, the United States started imposing tariffs on $34-billion-worth of Chinese goods, setting the trade war with China in motion and putting the torch to free trade and the global rules-based order. It was a sinister move designed to bully the worldâ\\x80\\x99s second largest economy.\\n\\n\\tThe tariffs, which are a complete violation of WTO rules, have been criticized as â\\x80\\x9ctrade bullying tacticsâ\\x80\\x9d by Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s Ministry of Commerce and have also been denounced by experts from both China and abroad.\\n\\n\\tThe logic that bullying China will make America â\\x80\\x9cgreat againâ\\x80\\x9d is flawed. It is silly to think that the Trump administrationâ\\x80\\x99s bullying tactics will scare China, and slapping its largest trading partner in the face and bucking the global trend toward greater openness suggest that Uncle Sam may have lost his mind.\\n\\n\\tThe thinking that trade wars are good and easy to win is a dangerous myth. It is wishful thinking to believe that America can and will win the trade war. On Monday, for example, the Washington-based International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has played a part in shaping the global economy since the end of World War II, warned that rising trade tensions between the United States and the rest of the world could cost the global economy about 0.5 percent by 2020, or about $430 billion in lost GDP worldwide.\\n\\n\\tThough all economies will suffer from further escalation, it is the United States that will bear the brunt of the trade warâ\\x80\\x99s huge cost. Based on public comments, it is clear that the Trump administration believes that America has more ammo for a trade war and so will come out on top in the end. But according to the IMF, it is the United States that has the most to lose in an all-out trade war.\\n\\n\\tOn Monday, the IMF warned that the United States is â\\x80\\x9cespecially vulnerable.â\\x80\\x9d The organization warned: â\\x80\\x9cAs the focus of global retaliation, the United States finds a relatively high share of its exports taxed in global markets in such a broader trade conflict, and it is therefore especially vulnerable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\tTrumpâ\\x80\\x99s bullying tactics are not even having the desired effect of slowing the Chinese economy. According to official data, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s second-quarter GPD advanced to 6.7 percent amid escalating trade tensions. Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s growth rate is not only within expectations, but is on par to surpass the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s 2018 growth target of 6.5 percent.\\n\\n\\tThe bullying tactics are, however, having an effect on the American economy. On the $34-billion US tariffs list, about $20 billion of the goods are produced by foreign companies in China, and American companies account for a considerable proportion. This means that American companies and, ultimately, everyday Americans, will pay the price for Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s trade war. To make matters worse, the Trump administration raised the stakes by threatening to hit China with another $200 billion in tariffs, which, if carried out, would have damaging ripple effects across the globe.\\n\\n\\tAlready, US businesses are sounding the alarm over Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s bullying tactics. Recently, the US Chamber of Commerce warned that retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on US exports will make American-made goods more expensive, resulting in lost sales and ultimately lost jobs in Americaâ\\x80\\x94as many as 2.6 million American jobs, according to the Chamber.\\n\\n\\tâ\\x80\\x9cImposing tariffs on imported goods will hit American consumers and businessesâ\\x80\\x94including manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and technology companiesâ\\x80\\x94with higher costs on commonly used products and materials,â\\x80\\x9d the Chamber warned, adding: â\\x80\\x9cSimply put, tariffs are a tax on American consumers and businesses.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\tAmerica will never be \"great again\" without China, because the economies of the two countries are deeply intertwined. The two sides must work together to manage their relationship. But if the Trump administration really wants to bully other countries, it stands to reason that China will fight till the bitter end to defend the interests of the nation and its people, and also stand up for the global trading system.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/0718/c90000-9482184.html'}\n"

As long as we prioritize the interests of the two countries\\' people, the right choice is apparent and the decision is not difficult to make.\"\\n\\n\\tCui Tiankai has also suggested the root cause of the trade imbalance between the two countries is the US economic structure, rather than China.\\n\\n\\t\"China does not pursue trade surplus with the US. It also hopes to see balance. The huge US trade deficit to China is caused by many factors, including issues in industrial chain, economic structure, low savings rate, and polices of the US. US government intends to restrict high-tech product export to China in private sector â\\x80\\x93 we want to buy, they don\\'t want to sell. This also fuels the deficit.\"\\n\\n\\tChina and US economic and trade ties have experienced almost continual growth since the establishment of diplomatic relations.\\n\\n\\tTrade volumes last year exceeded 580 billion US dollars, due in-part to bilateral investment.\\n\\n\\tIn 2017, US aircraft maker Boeing\\'s deliveries to China accounted for 26-percent of its total global deliveries.\\n\\n\\tUS soybean exports to China accounted for over 60-percent of the US total last year.\\n\\n\\tAs such, Cui Tiankai says itâ\\x80\\x99s been unfair for US politicians and the President to suggest that \"China is stealing jobs from American people.\"\\n\\n\\t\"I think both Chines and American workers have the rights to ideal jobs and better life. Their wishes deserve fulfillment. But this is not the sole drive for Chinese workers to come to the US. They come to the US mainly as a result of the US companies that expand their resource allocation and production across the globe in order to maximize their profit. This greatly benefits US economy.

He said the claim of building a community with a shared future for mankind, pioneered by Xi, is an important contribution to the world.\\n\\n\\tGuterres also said that the UN is undergoing reforms to improve work efficiency to better serve the people around the world.\\n\\n\\tPeace and development are the two major goals for the UN and achieving development and spreading peace are the fundamental roots for overcoming global challenges. During the 70th Anniversary Summit of the UN in 2015, Xi announced the establishment of China-UN Peace and Development fund to support the development of multilateralism.

He said the summit was an effective way for China to discuss the challenges of globalization. He said the Belt and Road policies are bringing peace to the region and that he looks forward to the expansion of cooperation between the UN and China in the future.\\n\\n\\tWith 2,400 active peacekeepers in dangerous areas around the world and an additional 8,000 standby peacekeepers in its ranks, China is the largest troop contributor to the UN and its second largest provider of funds.\\n\\n\\tWhen it comes to China participating in UN peacekeeping operations, Guterres said he remembers every detail clearly.

He said one of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s most unique aspects is its ability to absorb positive characteristics from other nations and cultures to make itself better through this integration.\\n\\n\\tGuterres said the positivity of Chinese culture is worth learning for the entire world, since they can learn the importance of peace, communication and mutual understanding from them.\\n\\n\\tThese traits are especially important in modern times, as global communities are facing more and more challenges, he noted.\\n\\n\\tRelated:\\xa0Op-ed: 2018 Boao Forum sets new starting line for peaceful development, win-win cooperation\\n\\n\\tChinese President Xi Jinping will deliver a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the 2018 Boao Forum for Asia (BFA), and attend a host of other activities during the four-day forum scheduled to open on April 8 in Boao, a coastal town in the southern island province of Hainan.\\n\\n\\tRelated: World sets sight on Boao forum for fresh impetus of globalization\\n\\n\\tIn a world troubled by grave uncertainties over growing protectionism, China is highly expected to inject new vitality into globalization and free trade.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/0410/c90000-9447303.html'}\n"

He said the claim of building a community with a shared future for mankind, pioneered by Xi, is an important contribution to the world.\\n\\n\\tGuterres also said that the UN is undergoing reforms to improve work efficiency to better serve the people around the world.\\n\\n\\tPeace and development are the two major goals for the UN and achieving development and spreading peace are the fundamental roots for overcoming global challenges. During the 70th Anniversary Summit of the UN in 2015, Xi announced the establishment of China-UN Peace and Development fund to support the development of multilateralism. The fund sponsored and helped multiple departments of the UN on dozens of projects.\\n\\n\\tGuterres praised Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s partnership with the UN, saying that China is the backbone of multilateralism since the country actively participates in global development and cooperation, while also working to explore and solve global challenges with the international community for the global governance mechanism.\\n\\n\\tGuterres also said he was happy to participate in the 2017 Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing. He said the summit was an effective way for China to discuss the challenges of globalization. He said the Belt and Road policies are bringing peace to the region and that he looks forward to the expansion of cooperation between the UN and China in the future.\\n\\n\\tWith 2,400 active peacekeepers in dangerous areas around the world and an additional 8,000 standby peacekeepers in its ranks, China is the largest troop contributor to the UN and its second largest provider of funds.\\n\\n\\tWhen it comes to China participating in UN peacekeeping operations, Guterres said he remembers every detail clearly. Guterres said the UNâ\\x80\\x99s peacekeeper troops in their stylized blue helmets create a recognizable image for the organization. Guterres said he appreciates the fact that China is committed to supporting the UNâ\\x80\\x99s peacekeeping efforts and its actions on strengthening global peacekeeping operations.\\n\\n\\tAt the 70th UN General Assembly on September 28, 2015, Xi made the solemn pledge that China will join the new UN Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System and form an 8,000-member standby peacekeeping force. China has since honored its commitments.\\n\\n\\tDuring Guterresâ\\x80\\x99s first official visit to China as UN Secretary-General, he was able to visit Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s peacekeeping force training center, which is the largest of its kind in Asia. It was regarded by Guterres as a showcase of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s contribution to world peace. He also believes that China will play a leading role in the UNâ\\x80\\x99s peacekeeping system in the future.\\n\\n\\tAs several international issues â\\x80\\x93 such as the Korean Peninsula, Syrian crisis, the war in Afghanistan â\\x80\\x93 are hot topics in the news, people are also starting to see the positive influence that China has on international and local issues. China recently played a key role in starting talks for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula when the country hosted North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in March.\\n\\n\\tGuterres said China is important for peaceful talks between North and South Korea and will play a major role going forward. Guterres said that China was â\\x80\\x9cirreplaceableâ\\x80\\x9d in these peace talks, and that war would have happened if a similar issue happened elsewhere in areas like the Southern Pacific or Africa.\\n\\n\\tGuterres made his first visit to China in 1984 and made several more visits through the years under different positions.\\n\\n\\tHe witnessed the dramatic changes that China went through after practicing Reform and Opening-up policies for 40 years.\\n\\n\\tAs the former head of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Guterres said the Chinese government has helped millions of people by eradicating poverty. He said the sheer size of poverty alleviation was impressive and unique.\\n\\n\\tToday, China is about to start a historic undertaking as it aims to promote a fully open economy with a broader view, a higher requirement, and more powerful actions.\\n\\n\\tGuterres said he expects to hear Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s new reform and innovation measures to the world and how the countryâ\\x80\\x99s development and improvement will benefit its people during Xiâ\\x80\\x99s keynote speech at the Boao Forum.\\n\\n\\tAs China play a role of growing importance in the world, its people are also becoming concerned for issues including climate change, wildlife protection, and humanitarian actions. Guterres said he is glad to see Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s youth becoming involved in these issues.\\n\\n\\tTo show his support for Chinese culture, Guterres attended a Beijing Opera during his visit. He said one of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s most unique aspects is its ability to absorb positive characteristics from other nations and cultures to make itself better through this integration.\\n\\n\\tGuterres said the positivity of Chinese culture is worth learning for the entire world, since they can learn the importance of peace, communication and mutual understanding from them.\\n\\n\\tThese traits are especially important in modern times, as global communities are facing more and more challenges, he noted.\\n\\n\\tRelated:\\xa0Op-ed: 2018 Boao Forum sets new starting line for peaceful development, win-win cooperation\\n\\n\\tChinese President Xi Jinping will deliver a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the 2018 Boao Forum for Asia (BFA), and attend a host of other activities during the four-day forum scheduled to open on April 8 in Boao, a coastal town in the southern island province of Hainan.\\n\\n\\tRelated: World sets sight on Boao forum for fresh impetus of globalization\\n\\n\\tIn a world troubled by grave uncertainties over growing protectionism, China is highly expected to inject new vitality into globalization and free trade.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/0410/c90000-9447303.html'}\n"

This is of great immediate significance and far-reaching historical significance.\\n\\n\\tAll regions and all government departments have strengthened their consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment.

Consumer prices have risen at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent, maintaining a relatively low level of growth. More than 66 million new urban jobs have been added, and our country, with its population of over 1.3 billion, has achieved relatively full employment.\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, the structure of the Chinese economy has seen a major transformation.\\n\\n\\tWith the share of the service sector rising from 45.3 to 51.6 percent of the economy, consumptionâ\\x80\\x99s contribution to growth has increased from 54.9 to 58.8 percent, becoming the main driver of growth. High-tech manufacturing has achieved an average annual increase of 11.7 percent, and the annual grain yield has reached 600 million metric tons. Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s urbanization rate has risen from 52.6 to 58.5 percent, and more than 80 million people who have relocated from rural to urban areas have gained permanent urban residency.\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, innovation-driven development has yielded fruitful outcomes.\\n\\n\\tChinaâ\\x80\\x99s investment in research and development (R&D) has grown at an average annual rate of 11 percent, ranking second in the world in scale. The contribution of technological advances to economic growth has risen from 52.2 to 57.5 percent. In manned spaceflight, deep-water exploration, quantum communications, large aircraft development, and more, China has seen a stream of major outcomes of innovation. In high-speed rail, e-commerce, mobile payments, and the sharing economy, China is leading the world.\\n\\n\\tThe Internet Plus model has permeated many different fields and industries. Business startups and innovation are thriving all over the country, and the average number of new businesses opened daily has risen from over 5,000 to more than 16,000. Rapidly emerging new growth drivers are reshaping Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s growth model, are profoundly changing the way we live and work, and have become a new hallmark of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s innovation-driven development.\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, significant headway has been made in reform and opening up.\\n\\n\\tIn reform, we have made strong moves across the board, secured major advances in many areas, and driven deeper in pursuing progress, making breakthroughs in reforms in important fields and at key links and seeing that\\xa0in the main areas the general frameworks for reform are basically established. Reforms to streamline administration and delegate powers, improve regulation, and optimize services, have driven profound shifts in the functions of government, and significantly strengthened market dynamism and public creativity. Notable achievements have been made in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The composition of both Chinese foreign trade and foreign investment in China has been improved, with volumes ranking among the largest in the world.\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, living standards have been constantly improving.\\n\\n\\tWe have made decisive progress in the fight against poverty: More than 68 million people have been lifted out of poverty, including a total of 8.3 million relocated from inhospitable areas, and the poverty headcount ratio has dropped from 10.2 to 3.1 percent. Personal income has increased by an annual average of 7.4 percent, outpacing economic growth and creating the worldâ\\x80\\x99s largest middle-income group. Tourist departures have grown from 83 million to over 130 million. Education has seen all-around development. Social old-age pension schemes now cover more than 900 million people, and basic health insurance plans cover 1.35 billion people, forming the largest social safety net in the world. On average, life expectancy has reached 76.7 years. Over 26 million housing units have been rebuilt in rundown urban areas and more than 17 million dilapidated houses have been renovated in rural areas, with the result that more than one hundred million Chinese have moved into new homes.\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, the environment has seen gradual improvement.\\n\\n\\tTo address air, water, and soil pollution, we have designed and enforced a ten-point list of measures for each and achieved solid progress. Both energy and water consumption per unit of GDP have fallen more than 20 percent, the release of major pollutants has been consistently declining, and the number of days of heavy air pollution in key cities has fallen 50 percent. Forest coverage has increased by 10.87 million hectares, and the area of desertified land has been reduced by close to 2,000 square kilometers on average each year. Encouraging progress has been made in green development.\\n\\n\\tIn the year just passed, all main targets and tasks for economic and social development were accomplished and performance exceeded expectations. GDP grew 6.9 percent and personal income rose 7.3 percent, both beating the previous yearâ\\x80\\x99s growth rates. Around 13.51 million new urban jobs were created, and the jobless rate was at its lowest level in years. Industrial growth began to rebound, and corporate profits increased 21 percent. Government revenue grew 7.4 percent, reversing the slowdown in growth. The total\\xa0import and export value rose 14.2 percent. Inward foreign investment reached 136.3 billion U.S. dollars, hitting a new all-time high.\\n\\n\\tThe state of play in the economy was good, with growth and quality, structural improvement, and performance each reinforcing the other. This is the result of the cumulative effect of a raft of major policies over the past five years and of consistent efforts in all areas of endeavor.\\n\\n\\tThe past five years have seen groundbreaking achievements on every front and profound and fundamental changes, attracting global attention and bringing all of us in China pride and inspiration.\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, we have worked with dedication to implement the decisions and plans made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core. The following are the highlights of that work:\\n\\n\\tFirst, with a commitment to the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, we have focused on developing new and better approaches to macro regulation, kept major indicators within an appropriate range, and achieved stable, positive economic performance.\\n\\n\\tThe past few years have witnessed anemic world economic recovery, volatility in global financial markets, and a sharp rise in protectionism. In China, structural issues and underlying problems have become more acute, downward pressure on the economy has continued to mount, and we have met with no small number of dilemmas.\\n\\n\\tIn facing this new environment, we have maintained strategic focus and refrained from resorting to a deluge of strong stimulus policies. Instead, we have adapted to, addressed, and steered the new normal in economic development, and taken coordinated steps to ensure steady growth, advance reform, make structural adjustments, improve living standards, and guard against risk. We have made fresh innovations in and refined macro regulation, developed the idea of and ways to achieve range-based regulation, and enhanced targeted, well-timed, and precision regulation.\\n\\n\\tWe have been clear that as long as the major economic indicators are within an acceptable range, with employment growing, incomes increasing, and the environment improving, then our energies should be focused on advancing reform, making structural adjustments, and adding growth drivers.\\n\\n\\tWe have adopted measures that are good for the near term and even better for the long term, made strong moves to advance supply-side structural reform, appropriately expanded aggregate demand, and worked for a dynamic equilibrium of supply and demand at a higher level.\\n\\n\\tWith grit and determination, we have overcome downward pressure on the economy, avoided a â\\x80\\x9chard landing,â\\x80\\x9d maintained a medium-high growth rate, and promoted structural upgrading. The economic fundamentals that will sustain long-term growth have been cemented and enhanced.\\n\\n\\tWe have continued to follow a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy. Despite a fairly big imbalance between government revenue and expenditure, China has led the way in slashing taxes and fees with the aim of using accommodative measures to strengthen the basis for sustained growth. Step by step, we have extended the replacement of business tax with value added tax (VAT) to all sectors across the country, calling time on the 66-year history of business tax. The result so far has been a tax cut of more than 2 trillion yuan. We have also adopted measures like preferential tax policies for small low-profit businesses and an overhaul of different types of fees. All in all, our market entities have seen savings of more than 3 trillion yuan. We have strengthened management over local government debt, and issued local government bonds to replace outstanding debt, cutting interest liability by 1.2 trillion yuan. We have adjusted the structure of government expenditure, put idle funds to work, and ensured the spending for undertaking major projects and meeting basic public needs. The deficit-to-GDP ratio has been kept within 3 percent.\\n\\n\\tMonetary policy has remained prudent and neutral. The M2 money supply growth rate has been trending downward, while credit and aggregate financing have seen moderate growth. Differentiated policies, such as targeted reserve requirement ratio cuts and targeted re-lending, have been adopted to strengthen support for key fields and weak links. The growth of loans to small and micro businesses has outstripped the average growth in lending. We have reformed and improved the market-based exchange rate mechanism and kept the RMB exchange rate basically stable; and foreign exchange reserves are now rising not falling. We have responded appropriately to abnormal market fluctuations such as the cash crunch, brought better order to the financial markets, prevented and defused risks in key sectors, forestalled systemic risk, and thus safeguarded Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s economic and financial security.\\n\\n\\tSecond, with a commitment to treating supply-side structural reform as our main task, we have focused on fostering new growth drivers and sped up economic structural upgrading.\\n\\n\\tWe have persevered in relying on reform to overcome economic difficulties and address structural imbalances, made a big push to foster emerging industries, overhauled and strengthened traditional industries, and improved the quality and performance of the supply system.\\n\\n\\tSolid work has moved us forward in the five priority tasks of cutting overcapacity, reducing excess inventory, deleveraging, lowering costs, and strengthening areas of weakness.\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, building on work to cut backward production capacity in the cement, plate glass, and other industries, we have intensified efforts to cut overcapacity, prioritizing industries such as steel and coal; and a 100-billion-yuan fund for rewards and subsidies has been put in place by the central government to support efforts to assist affected employees. We have cut steel production capacity by more than 170 million metric tons and coal production capacity by 800 million metric tons, and over 1.1 million affected employees have been assisted.\\n\\n\\tThanks to city-specific policies and category-specific guidance, clear progress has been made in reducing commercial residential housing inventory in third- and fourth-tier cities, and the growth of housing prices in the most popular cities has been brought under control.\\n\\n\\tWe have taken active and prudent steps to deleverage, control the scale of debts, and expand equity finance. The debt-to-asset ratio of industrial enterprises has been consistently declining. Macro leverage ratio is increasing by much smaller margins and is generally stable.\\n\\n\\tWe have used a combination of measures to bring down costs: 30 percent of government-managed funds and fees have been cut; over 60 percent of the fees and charges levied on businesses by the central government have been abolished; the ratio of enterprise contributions to old-age pension, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, and maternity insurance, workersâ\\x80\\x99 compensation, and housing provident fund schemes has been reduced for the time being, and work has been done to lower energy, logistics, and telecommunications costs.\\n\\n\\tAnd, with a focus on key issues, we have stepped up efforts to strengthen areas of weakness.\\n\\n\\tWe have sped up the replacement of old growth drivers.\\n\\n\\tWe have taken extensive action under the Internet Plus Initiative, exercised accommodative and prudential regulation, and promoted the extensive application of big data, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things; emerging industries have achieved vigorous growth, and traditional industries have undergone a thorough remodeling.\\n\\n\\tImplementation of the Made in China 2025 initiative has brought progress in major projects like the building of robust industrial foundations, smart manufacturing, and green manufacturing, and has accelerated the development of advanced manufacturing.\\n\\n\\tWe unveiled reform and development measures to foster modern services; and this has led to a marked rise in new forms of business in the service sector and new service models as well as the integration and upgrading of multiple sectors.\\n\\n\\tDeepened supply-side structural reform in agriculture has brought the emergence of a large number of new types of agribusiness. The share of appropriately scaled-up farming has increased from 30 to over 40 percent.\\n\\n\\tWe have taken measures to increase the incomes of those in low- and middle-income brackets, and helped to see an upgrading of traditional forms of consumption, and a boom in new forms of consumption. Online retail sales have been growing at an average annual rate of over 30 percent, and total retail sales of consumer goods have enjoyed an average annual increase of 11.3 percent.\\n\\n\\tWe have improved the composition of investment, encouraged private investment, used government investment to play a catalytic role, and guided more funding toward areas that strengthen the economic foundation, enhance sustainability, and improve peopleâ\\x80\\x99s lives.\\n\\n\\tChinaâ\\x80\\x99s in-operation high-speed railways have grown from over 9,000 to 25,000 kilometers, accounting for two thirds of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s total. Our expressways have grown from 96,000 to 136,000 kilometers. We have built or upgraded 1.27 million kilometers of rural roads, built 46 new civilian airports, and begun work on 122 major water conservancy projects. We have completed the latest round of rural power grid upgrading, and put in place the largest mobile broadband network in the world.\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, new growth drivers have rapidly grown in strength. Economic growth, in the past mainly driven by investment and exports, is now being fueled by consumption, investment, and exports. In the past dependent mainly on secondary industry, growth is now powered by a combination of the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. This is a major structural transformation that for years our sights had been set on but we were never able to achieve.\\n\\n\\tAdvancing supply-side structural reform demands removing barriers to the market-based allocation of the factors of production and reducing government-imposed transaction costs.\\n\\n\\tTo address the longstanding issues of excessive emphasis on approval procedures, insufficient attention to regulatory processes, and a failure to provide strong services, we have been consistently deepening reforms to streamline administration, delegate powers, improve regulation, and strengthen services. We have sped up efforts to transform government functions, reduced micromanagement and direct intervention, and done more to improve macro regulation, market regulation, and public services.\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, the number of items subject to approval by State Council offices and departments has been slashed by 44 percent, the practice of non-administrative approval has been completely put to a stop, the number of business investment items subject to central government approval has been cut by 90 percent, intermediary services needed for obtaining government approval have been cut by 74 percent, and the requirements for professional qualification approval and accreditation have been significantly reduced. The number of items for which central government sets the prices has been cut back by 80 percent, and local government-priced items have been cut down by over 50 percent. Comprehensive reforms have swept the business system, including business registration and registered capital, reducing the time it takes to start a business by over a third.\\n\\n\\tWe have developed new and better ways of conducting compliance oversight, and introduced a new model of oversight combining randomly selected inspectors who inspect randomly selected entities and the prompt release of results. These efforts have made regulation more effective and impartial.\\n\\n\\tWe have rolled out the Internet Plus Government Services model and adopted measures such as the one-stop service model.\\n\\n\\tThanks to the above reforms, the business environment has consistently improved, the market is more energized, and people can access government services more easily.\\n\\n\\tThird, with a commitment to innovation-driven development, and a focus on unlocking public creativity, we have achieved a remarkable overall improvement in innovation capacity and efficiency.\\n\\n\\tWe have put into action the innovation-driven development strategy and worked to build a better ecosystem for innovation, giving shape to innovation involving multiple actors making across-the-board advances.\\n\\n\\tResearch institutes and universities now have greater say over their research; research projects and funding are better managed, and the way that rights and interests relating to scientific and technological advances are managed has undergone reform.\\n\\n\\tWe have moved forward with piloting comprehensive innovation reform, supported Beijing and Shanghai in building themselves into centers for scientific and technological innovation, and set up 14 new national innovation demonstration zones, thus creating a number of regional innovation hubs.\\n\\n\\tWe have boosted the development of a system for technological innovation in which enterprises are the main actors. China has seen the emergence of a number of world-class innovative enterprises and new kinds of R&D institutions.\\n\\n\\tWe have launched and taken bold moves in the nationwide business startup and innovation initiative, adopted supportive policies designed to benefit all entrepreneurs and innovators, and improved incubation systems.\\n\\n\\tChinaâ\\x80\\x99s market entities, all types included, now total over 98 million, an increase of more than 70 percent over the past five years. The number of in-force Chinese invention patents issued in China has tripled, and the volume of technology transactions has doubled. In the global race of scientific and technological innovation, China has shifted place, from following others to keeping pace and even leading the pack in more and more areas. Our country has become a globally recognized fertile ground for innovation and business ventures.\\n\\n\\tFourth, with a commitment to deepening reform across the board, we have taken major steps to remove institutional barriers, thus steadily boosting the driving forces powering development.\\n\\n\\tSolid progress has been made in state capital and state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform; the reform to convert SOEs into standard companies has now basically been completed; and efforts to merge and restructure, reduce the organizational levels in, and improve the quality and efficiency of, SOEs have made good progress. The performance of SOEs has been much improved, with profits last year growing by 23.5 percent. We have deepened reform in sectors like energy, rail, and the salt industry.\\n\\n\\tMarket access to the non-public sector has been expanded. An integrated registration system for immovable property has been put in place, and the property rights protection system has been improved.\\n\\n\\tFiscal and tax reforms have made major progress. We have introduced the requirement nationwide for government budgets and final accounts to be released to the public, developed a system based mainly on tax sharing for dividing revenue between central and local government, launched the reform to define the respective financial powers and expenditure responsibilities of central and local government, and significantly scaled up general transfer payments from central to local government, while also cutting by two thirds the number of items for which special purpose transfer payments are made.\\n\\n\\tWe have largely lifted controls on interest rates, established a deposit insurance system, encouraged large and medium commercial banks to set up inclusive finance divisions, deepened the reform of policy-backed and development financial institutions, and strengthened the mechanisms for coordinating financial regulation.\\n\\n\\tWe have made steady progress in the comprehensive reform of education, improved the mechanisms for promoting more balanced development of urban and rural compulsory education, and reformed the examination and enrollment systems.\\n\\n\\tWe have established unified basic pension and health insurance schemes for rural and non-working urban residents, and brought government office and public institution pension schemes into line with enterprise schemes. We have unveiled a plan for the appropriation of a portion of state capital to replenish social security funds.\\n\\n\\tWe have carried out coordinated medical service, medical insurance, and pharmaceutical reforms. We have introduced comprehensive reform in all public hospitals, rescinded the longstanding policy of allowing hospitals to profit from higher priced medicine, and made breakthroughs in the reform of approval systems for medicine and medical devices.\\n\\n\\tWe have pursued reform to separate rural land ownership rights, contract rights, and use rights, and already seen over 80 percent of contracted rural land covered by this reform. We have reformed the system for purchasing and stockpiling important agricultural products.\\n\\n\\tWe have improved the functional zoning system, established performance evaluation and accountability systems for ecological conservation, and instituted the river chief and lake chief systems. We have piloted a system placing government environmental offices below the provincial level directly under the supervision of provincial-level environmental offices.\\n\\n\\tThe deepening of reform in each and every field has given a boost to sustained, healthy economic and social development.\\n\\n\\tFifth, with a commitment to Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s fundamental policy of opening up, we have focused on promoting win-win cooperation, and significantly improved the performance of our countryâ\\x80\\x99s open economy.\\n\\n\\tWe have launched and worked with other countries in the Belt and Road Initiative. We initiated the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, set up the Silk Road Fund, and launched a number of major connectivity and economic and trade cooperation initiatives.\\n\\n\\tPilot free trade zones have been established in Shanghai and 10 other provinces and cities. A number of successful outcomes from pilot reforms are now being applied nationwide.\\n\\n\\tWe have reformed the cost-sharing mechanism for export tax rebates, and the central government now pays the full sum of increases in export tax rebates. We have set up 13 comprehensive experimental zones for cross-border e-commerce. Single-window document processing for international trade has been applied nationwide, cutting the average time for customs clearance by over half. Imports and exports have rebounded and steadily grown.\\n\\n\\tFor foreign investment, we have replaced the approval system with a negative list model, and have cut restrictions by two thirds. The composition of foreign investment has improved, with investment in high-tech industries doubling. We have intensified efforts to attract talent, and the number of foreign experts working in China has grown by 40 percent.\\n\\n\\tWe have guided the healthy development of outbound investment. We have moved forward with international cooperation on production capacity; high-speed rail, nuclear power, and other types of Chinese equipment have entered international markets. We have signed or upgraded eight free trade agreements. We have launched the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, and the Bond Connect. The RMB was included in the IMFâ\\x80\\x99s Special Drawing Rights basket, representing a major step forward in its internationalization.\\n\\n\\tChina has opened its doors wider to the world. This opening has played a powerful role in our own development, and it presents important opportunities for the rest of the world.\\n\\n\\tSixth, with a commitment to implementing the coordinated regional development and new urbanization strategies, we have promoted more balanced development, and seen new growth poles and belts developing faster.\\n\\n\\tWe have actively pursued the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, and the development of the Yangtze Economic Belt, drawn up and implemented related plans, and undertaken a number of key projects. We have unveiled a whole series of reforms and innovative measures to see the western region develop, northeast China revitalized, the central region rise, and the eastern region spearhead development. We have stepped up support for old revolutionary base areas, areas with large ethnic minority populations, border areas, and poor areas, and strengthened work to support Tibet, Xinjiang, and Qinghai. We have steadily moved forward with protecting and developing maritime resources.\\n\\n\\tWe have implemented plans for developing major city clusters, and pursued more balanced development of small, medium, and large cities, and small towns. The vast majority of cities in China have eased restrictions on permanent residency. A residence card system has been put into effect nationwide, and basic urban public services now cover all permanent residents. Development between urban and rural areas and between regions has become better coordinated.\\n\\n\\tSeventh, with a commitment to a people-centered development philosophy, we have endeavored to ensure and improve living standards, and the people are increasingly feeling the benefit.\\n\\n\\tDespite fiscal constraints, we have consistently increased spending on improving peopleâ\\x80\\x99s living standards. We have made comprehensive moves in targeted poverty reduction and alleviation, and built a robust working mechanism with central government responsible for overall planning, provincial-level governments assuming overall responsibility, and city and county governments responsible for program implementation. Over the past five years, the central government has appropriated over 280 billion yuan to fund poverty reduction.\\n\\n\\tWe have implemented a proactive employment policy and ensured that key target groups have better access to employment.\\n\\n\\tWe have been committed to prioritizing the development of education; and government spending on education has remained above four percent of GDP.

We have carried out Fitness-for-All programs, which are now in full swing; and Chinese athletes have excelled in competition.\\n\\n\\tEighth, with a commitment to achieving harmony between human and nature, we have taken major steps to address pollution, and achieved notable progress in ecological conservation.\\n\\n\\tWe have established the notion that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets and acted with resolve and intensity as never before to strengthen environmental protection.\\n\\n\\tWe have struck out hard against air pollution, thus achieving a drop of over 30 percent in the average density of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in key areas. We have done more to reduce the use of low quality coal, pushed for progress in energy conservation and emission reductions in key industries, and seen 71 percent of coal-fired power plants achieving ultra-low emissions. We have improved the energy mix, cutting the share of coal consumption by 8.1 percentage points and increasing the share of clean energy consumption by 6.3 percentage points. We have improved fuel quality, and taken over 20 million high-emission and old vehicles off the roads.\\n\\n\\tWe have strengthened prevention and control measures against water pollution in key drainage basins and sea areas, and achieved zero growth in chemical fertilizer and pesticide use. We have pursued major ecological conservation and restoration projects, expanded the coverage of initiatives to turn marginal farmland into forest, grassland, and wetlands, and intensified comprehensive efforts to curb desertification, rock desertification, and soil erosion.\\n\\n\\tWe have launched central government inspections on environmental protection, investigated and prosecuted cases involving legal violations, and strengthened accountability.

We have reformed and improved food and drug regulation and strengthened risk control over all related processes.\\n\\n\\tWe have strengthened work on preventing, reducing, and providing relief for disasters, including earthquakes and serious flooding, and built stronger emergency response mechanisms employing a division of responsibilities between levels and close coordination. With this we have minimized the damage and loss inflicted by disasters to the greatest possible extent.\\n\\n\\tChinaâ\\x80\\x99s national security is better safeguarded. We have improved the crime prevention and control system, worked in accordance with law to hit back against all types of crime and illegal behavior, and effectively safeguarded public security.\\n\\n\\tWe have implemented the Party Central Committeeâ\\x80\\x99s decisions on exercising full and strict Party self-governance and done more to improve Party conduct, build a clean government, and fight corruption.

This anti-corruption campaign has built into a crushing tide, and is being consolidated and developed.\\n\\n\\tFellow Deputies,\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, we have made new improvements in work related to ethnic groups, religion, and overseas Chinese nationals. We have supported faster development in areas with large ethnic minority populations, and have seen efforts to promote ethnic unity and progress truly paying off. We have actively guided religions in adapting to socialist society. Overseas Chinese nationals, Chinese nationals who have returned from overseas, and the relatives of overseas Chinese nationals who reside in China have made their own unique contributions to the countryâ\\x80\\x99s modernization.\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, we have embarked on a new stage in strengthening and energizing the armed forces. We have developed a military strategy for new conditions; convened the Gutian military political work meeting; and taken extensive steps to see that the armed forces are built on political loyalty, strengthened through reform and technology, and run in accordance with law. As a result, our peopleâ\\x80\\x99s armed forces have achieved a remodeling of their political ecosystem, of the way they are organized, of the structure of their forces, and of their conduct and image.\\n\\n\\tWe have undertaken major missions involving the protection of maritime rights, countering terrorism and maintaining stability, disaster rescue and relief, international peacekeeping, escort services in the Gulf of Aden, and humanitarian rescue. With the cooperation of all involved, we have basically completed the task of reducing military personnel by 300,000. Military equipment has been significantly modernized and military-civilian integration has been deepened. We have seen closer unity between the military and government and between the military and the people. The peopleâ\\x80\\x99s armed forces, full of new drive, have taken solid strides toward building themselves into a powerful military with Chinese characteristics.\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, fresh progress has been made in work related to Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The practice of â\\x80\\x9cone country, two systemsâ\\x80\\x9d has been consistently enriched and developed; the authority of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s Constitution and the basic laws has become more evident in Hong Kong and Macao. Exchanges and cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao have been steadily enhanced; the construction of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge has been completed, and Hong Kong and Macao have thrived and remained stable.\\n\\n\\tWe have upheld the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, strengthened cross-Strait economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation, and held a historic meeting between the leaders of the two sides. We have resolutely opposed and deterred separatist forces advocating Taiwan independence, firmly safeguarding peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\\n\\n\\tOver the past five years, we have pursued distinctively Chinese major country diplomacy on all fronts. We successfully hosted the first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, the 22nd APEC Economic Leaders Meeting, the G20 Hangzhou Summit, the BRICS Xiamen Summit, and other major diplomatic events in China.\\n\\n\\tPresident Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders have visited many countries and attended major events including the United Nations summits, the Climate Change Conferences, World Economic Forum meetings, and the East Asian Leaders Meetings on Cooperation. Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s diplomatic agenda has been further advanced on every front.\\n\\n\\tChina has called for building a community with a shared future for humanity and has contributed more Chinese ideas to the reform of the global governance system. Notable achievements have been made in our countryâ\\x80\\x99s economic diplomacy and people-to-people and cultural exchanges. We have been resolute in upholding Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. As a responsible major country, China has played a constructive role in addressing international and regional hotspot issues, thus making significant new contributions to global peace and development.\\n\\n\\tFellow Deputies,\\n\\n\\tLooking back on the past five years, we have encountered a great many interwoven problems and a stream of risks and challenges. Both at home and abroad, there have been many new developments, developments that we have not faced since reform and opening up began. The achievements we have made in Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s reform and development have certainly not come easily. We owe them to the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, to the sound guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and to the concerted efforts of the Party, the military, and the people of all our nationâ\\x80\\x99s ethnic groups.\\n\\n\\tOn behalf of the State Council, I wish to express sincere thanks to the people of all our ethnic groups, and to all other political parties, peopleâ\\x80\\x99s organizations, and public figures from all sectors of society. I express our sincere appreciation to our fellow countrymen and women in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, in Taiwan, and overseas. I also wish to express our sincere thanks to the governments of other countries, international organizations, and friends from all over the world who have shown understanding and support for China in its endeavor to modernize.\\n\\n\\tAs the Chinese saying goes, when all is calm forget not danger; when all is well be awake to woes. We are keenly aware that China is still in the primary stage of socialism and will remain so for a long time to come, that it remains the largest developing country in the world, and that it faces a number of acute problems caused by unbalanced and inadequate development that so far remain unsolved.\\n\\n\\tThe internal forces powering economic growth are not yet sufficient, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s ability to innovate needs to be stronger, and the quality and performance of development need to be improved. Some enterprises, particularly small and medium ones, are finding it tough going. Growth in private investment is weak; some regions still face considerable downward economic pressure, and risks and potential dangers in the financial and other sectors are not to be ignored.\\n\\n\\tPoverty alleviation remains a formidable task; the foundations of agriculture and rural infrastructure remain weak, and the disparities in development between rural and urban areas, between regions, and in income distribution remain substantial. Serious and major workplace accidents happen all too often. People still have a lot of complaints about air quality, environmental sanitation, food and drug safety, housing, education, healthcare, employment, and elderly care.\\n\\n\\tThe transformation of government functions is not yet where it should be. In the work of government there are areas where we fall short. Some reform measures and policies have not been fully implemented. Some officials are weak on awareness that they are there to serve and must uphold the rule of law, and some lack commitment to their work and willingness to bear the weight of responsibility. Bureaucratism and the practice of formalities for formalitiesâ\\x80\\x99 sake exist to varying degrees. There are many complaints from the people and the business sector about the difficulty of accessing government services and the excessive array of charges. In some sectors misconduct and corruption are still a common problem.\\n\\n\\tWith a deep sense of responsibility to our country and people, with courage in the face of adversity, and with determination that wonâ\\x80\\x99t be broken, we must give our work all weâ\\x80\\x99ve got, to make sure that the peopleâ\\x80\\x99s government does not let the people down.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/0403/c90000-9445262.html'}\n"

Since Chinese President Xi Jinping made landmark speeches at the WEF in Davos and at the UN Office at Geneva a year ago, the idea \"to build a community with shared future for mankind\" has gained wider international recognition for offering China\\'s solutions to cope with global challenges. (Xinhua/Lan Hongguang)\\n\\n\\tPresident\\'s idea echoed globally in face of threat of parochialism\\n\\n\\tPresident Xi Jinping\\'s vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind has become an important international consensus echoed by many countries, organizations and political parties in the past year, according to international relations analysts.\\n\\n\\tAs political leaders including US President Donald Trump are meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to discuss the future of the global economy and politics this week, the proposals raised by Xi during his Swiss trip a year ago remain a positive force to improve global governance systems, analysts said.\\n\\n\\tXi said that by building a community with a shared future for mankind, people\\'s lives around the world can be improved, a view that still enlightens political and business leaders at this year\\'s meeting.\\n\\n\\tOn Jan 18, 2017, Xi made a keynote speech at the United Nations Office in Geneva titled Work Together to Build a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind, offering China\\'s solutions to cope with global challenges.\\n\\n\\t\"Building a community with a shared future is an exciting goal, and it requires efforts from generation after generation,\" Xi said. \"China is ready to work with all the other UN member states as well as international organizations and agencies to advance the great cause of building a community with a shared future for mankind.\"\\n\\n\\tThe president\\'s speech drew strong and positive feedback from the international community. A month later, the Chinese concept of building \"a human community with shared destiny\" was incorporated into a UN resolution for the first time at the 55th UN Commission for Social Development on Feb 11.\\n\\n\\tSince then, the idea has been endorsed by the UN Security Council, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly, turning the Chinese concept into an international consensus.\\n\\n\\tXi put forward the notion of \"a community of a shared future\" as early as March 2013, when he delivered a speech at Moscow State Institute of International Relations during his first trip overseas as president. Human society is becoming a community of a shared future, Xi said in the speech.\\n\\n\\tDuring annual meetings of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference from 2013 to 2015, Xi proposed to create the mentality of a community with a shared future, march to a community with a shared future, build a community with a shared future for Asia, and build a community with a shared future for mankind.\\n\\n\\tRana Mitter, director of the Dickson Poon University of Oxford China Centre, said that China\\'s role \"continues to be central\" to this year\\'s World Economic Forum meeting in Davos from Tuesday to Friday.\\n\\n\\t\"Xi\\'s speech last year set an agenda, and it is important that China continues to express a collaborative and engaged viewpoint as these questions are debated in the year to come,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tIssues of shared human values, economic integration and engagement during international crises, whether in the Middle East, South Asia or elsewhere, continue to be central global concerns, and China\\'s attitude toward these questions is crucial, he added.\\n\\n\\tJon Taylor, a China scholar and professor at the Political Science Department at Houston\\'s University of St. Thomas, said that Xi\\'s concept of a shared future for mankind is still quite relevant in a world in which Trump thinks that the parochial economic interests of the US take precedence over a global approach that is marked by increasing trade, capital flows and economic integration.\\n\\n\\t\"Xi\\'s observation from his 2017 Davos speech continues to resonate today in light of Trump\\'s populist and protectionist rhetoric: \\'Whether you like it or not, the global economy is the big ocean that you cannot escape from,\\'\" he said, quoting Xi.\\n\\n\\tErik Berglof, director of the Institute of Global Affairs at the London School of Economics, said that Xi\\'s speech at the UN Geneva Office a year ago came at a time \"when much of the world was looking for leadership on the global issues of trade, climate and development and a more optimistic view of the opportunities coming from globalization\".\\n\\n\\tBerglof spoke highly of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, saying that it is \"clearly a bold and open vision for global development\".\\n\\n\\tThe Belt and Road Initiative, which comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aims to build trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe and Africa via overland and maritime routes.\\n\\n\\tSince Xi put forward the initiative in 2013, China has signed cooperation documents with 80 countries and organizations, carried out industrial cooperation with more than 30 countries and helped build 75 economic and trade cooperation zones in 24 countries.\\n\\n\\tIn May, representatives from 130 countries, including 29 heads of state or government, and scores of international organizations, participated in the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, where more than 270 projects aimed at enhancing the global cooperation network were finalized.\\n\\n\\tStephen Perry, chairman of The 48 Group Club trade association, said that with regard to Xi\\'s comments on globalization and the Belt and Road Initiative last year, the concrete impact and outcomes \"are to be seen in transnational infrastructure development being incorporated across the world\".\\n\\n\\t\"Nations are not thinking of just building infrastructure for themselves, but for them and their neighbors. The world cannot do it on a national basis anymore. That is what they take from President Xi\\'s words,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tAlthough Xi is not present at this year\\'s panoply of leaders gathered in Davos, his presence and the presence of China has been felt there, said William Jones, the Washington bureau chief for Executive Intelligence Review, a US newsmagazine founded more than 40 years ago.\\n\\n\\t\"The rise of China, with its own particular philosophical outlook, has brought with it a new spirit, a spirit of harmony and cooperation,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tScott Kennedy, deputy director of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, said that the leaders of the World Economic Forum \"are very sensitive and aware that Xi Jinping\\'s speech last year was historic and very well received\".\\n\\n\\t\"They are also worried about the state of globalization, and the possibility of the outbreak of a US-China trade war, and the general anxieties about globalization that we\\'ve seen in Brexit, worries about the stability of the EU, the potential breakup of NAFTA and other areas,\" he said.\\n\\n\\t\"My hope would be that the rhetoric of openness and liberalization and reform ... increasing productivity is matched by actions by China and by others,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tEconomic globalization\\n\\n\\tXi, the first Chinese head of state to have attended the Davos meetings, called at last year\\'s World Economic Forum for joint efforts to chart the course of economic globalization and forge new models of global growth, cooperation, governance and development.\\n\\n\\t\"Whether you like it or not, the global economy is the big ocean that you cannot escape from. Any attempt to cut off the flow of capital, technologies, products, industries and people between economies, and channel the waters in the ocean back into isolated lakes and creeks, is simply not possible,\" Xi said.\\n\\n\\tThe president called on the international community to face up to the problems caused by globalization instead of dodging them.\\n\\n\\tKlaus Schwab, founder and chief executive of the World Economic Forum, told Xinhua News Agency recently that Xi\\'s address at the 2017 forum was historically significant.\\n\\n\\t\"What most impressed participants and the media was the president\\'s commitment to an open and collaborative spirit when addressing shared challenges,\" Schwab was quoted as saying.\\n\\n\\tOn Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his speech at the forum that protectionism was resulting in new trade barriers and reduced investment across borders.\\n\\n\\t\"The forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalization,\" he said. \"Their desire is to not only save themselves from globalization, but to reverse the natural flow of globalization altogether.\"\\n\\n\\tXi \"delivered a similar message in 2017,\" CNN said of Modi\\'s speech.\\n\\n\\tCNN said it is the second consecutive year that the leader of a major Asian power has used the coveted speaking slot to warn against a retreat from globalization.\\n\\n\\t\"President Xi Jinping\\'s statements, a year on, continue to be an important stage-setter for the argument that international trade must continue to flow openly and freely,\" said Mitter of the Oxford China Centre.\\n\\n\\tIf China and Europe cooperate in maintaining a liberalized global trading system, it will be an important signal to the wider world, he said.\\n\\n\\tZhao Huanxin and Chen Weihua in Washington contributed to this story.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/0126/c90000-9419955.html'}\n"

      "684,{'發稿日': ['December21', '2017'], '新聞標題': \"I'm Chinese, and this is how I see Taiwan\", '作者': \"People's Daily Online\", '新聞內文': 'During welcome week here at NYU, I heard a girl introducing herself: â\\x80\\x9cI\\'m from Taiwan. I\\'m Taiwanese.â\\x80\\x9d I feel heartbroken every time I hear the word â\\x80\\x9cTaiwan,â\\x80\\x9d and a part of me was waiting for her to say â\\x80\\x9cTaiwan, China.â\\x80\\x9d I have to say I was prepared, coming here, knowing that not everyone I meet will share the same view as I do. I was even told not to argue with people about this issue, but it still strikes me hard when I hear people speak of Taiwan without mentioning China. From what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve learned, both at school and at home, no matter historically or politically, the island of Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. Though this could be a personal issue I\\'m attached to, it also has political backgrounds.\\n\\n\\tLater, in my dorm, I read an article by Jane Perlez on The New York Times called â\\x80\\x9cChina Sees New Ambiguity with Donald Trump\\'s Taiwan Call.â\\x80\\x9d The article introduces the cause and effect of a phone call between president-elect Trump and Taiwanâ\\x80\\x99s leader Tsai Ing-wen. An expert from a university in China is quoted: â\\x80\\x9cMr. Trump broke a Chinese taboo merely by using Ms. Tsai\\'s title. Chinese media refers to Ms. Tsai as the \\'leader of the Taiwan region,\\' to indicate that Beijing regards Taiwan not like a sovereign nation but as Chinese territory to eventually be brought under its control.â\\x80\\x9d This is important because the one-China policy, agreed upon by the late US President Richard Nixon in 1978, is relationship bedrock for China-U.S. relations, yet the phone call no doubt challenged this consensus.\\n\\n\\tAdam Taylor, in his article \"With Trump in China, Taiwan worries about becoming a \\'bargaining chip,â\\x80\\x9d from The Washington Post, concludes, â\\x80\\x9cTaipei is pursuing a number of policies that seem [to be] designed [for currying] favor with the Trump administration, including a ban on all trade with North Korea.â\\x80\\x9d This develops the matter that China and the U.S. both want the DPRK to abandon its nuclear weapons program, however, Trump\\'s call diminished the bond between the two countries, thus making it harder for them to work together.\\n\\n\\tTo complicate matters, in article The New York Times op-ed titled \"Taiwan feels forgotten. But not by Trump,â\\x80\\x9d Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian illustrates how Taiwan feels abandoned and ignored, standing from the side of right deviated Taiwanese/standing with Taiwanâ\\x80\\x99s right deviation. Bethany quotes Tsai, \"We are this vibrant democracy, but people always forget about us.â\\x80\\x9d But Taiwan cannot be left out by the world, because it is not an independent country, and it can never be neglected within China, because it is a very important region that shapes China as a whole. Bethany\\'s article is not helpful for Americans to understand this complicated matter, and is counterproductive to the progress made in China-U.S. relations. Tsai\\'s political stance as right deviation is wrong and meaningless, because nothing can cut off the bond of blood between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan.\\n\\n\\tHistorically or politically, there has never been a controversy on whether Taiwan belongs to China or not. In 1885, Taiwan was established as a province of China, after being a city which belongs to Fujian province for many years. Though occupied by Japan during the Second World War, it came back to China with glory after Japan was defeated. Thereafter, the Kuomintang (KMT) fled to Taiwan, because they lost the civil war against the Communist Party of China (CPC), and since then, Chinese mainland and Taiwan have developed under different systems. But that doesn\\'t change the fact that Taiwan is still a part of China, and will always be a part of China. Ma Ying-jeou, the former leader of Taiwan, tried hard to deepen the connections with the mainland and made great progress in enhancing the relationship. However, as a radical right-deviate, Tsai keeps trying to push Taiwan away from its motherland China.\\n\\n\\tWhy do â\\x80\\x9cTaiwaneseâ\\x80\\x9d harbor this belief that they are a separate country?\\n\\n\\tIn my New Student Seminar class, I approached a Taiwanese girl and asked her why some Taiwanese people refuse to acknowledge the fact that theyâ\\x80\\x99re a part of China, and this question caught her by surprise. She never thought about it before and after a few seconds told me that all her beliefs are based on how she was raised and what she was taught; â\\x80\\x9cLike a religion,â\\x80\\x9d she said. The way she described how she gets offended when people mix up Taiwan as a part of China, and how there can only be â\\x80\\x9cTaipei, Chinaâ\\x80\\x9d in the Olympics, was very upsetting, and my feelings get hurt every time a Chinese person from Taiwan tries to separate themselves from Chinese mainland, or when I see a flag of Taiwan sitting next to other country flags. This mutual feeling of anger, sadness, and powerlessness actually places us on the same side.\\n\\n\\tThis complicated feeling we have toward our culture reminds me of Jamaica Kincaid, an American writer. Growing up as a colonial child, Kincaid conveys in her essay â\\x80\\x9cOn Seeing England for the First Timeâ\\x80\\x9d about how she was forced to see England. When she finally saw it, everything was not like how she was told. She wanted to fight for a change, and let her own people see the real England, and also let the world see what stereotyping did to them. She asked, â\\x80\\x9cWho were these people who forced me to think?â\\x80\\x9d which indicates that she was angry about being forced to see the world, hurt about losing her own culture over another that was disappointing, and felt powerless because what is done is done and she cannot change the history.\\n\\n\\tFor me, my question is: Who are these people to decide if they want one part of my country to belong to my country or not? I am angry because it is none of their business, hurt because some people who call themselves Taiwanese are pushing Chinese mainland away, and feel powerless because this is a huge political issue that I alone cannot change. When people accuse China of â\\x80\\x9ccoaxingâ\\x80\\x9d other countries to agree to the one-China policy, they need to understand that we Chinese are not \"coaxing\" anything. The problem is that their misinterpretation of \"Taiwan Independence\" is affecting their judgment. For the majority of people in Taiwan, it only means to have their own system, just like the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region does. In this sense, they already have their independence. People in the world need to recognize the fact that Taiwan, this Mandarin speaking island, is a part of China.\\n\\n\\tWhen I was talking to the Taiwanese girl, who is now my friend, we both agreed that it isn\\'t the place for the U.S. to try to decide its fate. Additionally, this historical controversy doesn\\'t prevent us from being friends. In fact, if not for this conversation, we probably would have never talked to each other. I finally understand why I was warned not to argue with people about this matterâ\\x80\\x94as a teenager, I should not worry about this political issue, nor could I have done anything to change it. \"Keep believing what you believe, but also try not to let this affect your life,\" my mom told me when I was telling her about this through FaceTime. I believe, historically, Taiwan never left China. I believe, economically, it makes no sense for Taiwan to leave Chinese mainland. I believe, people holding different beliefs can become great friends. I also believe, after all the difficult negotiations and sacrifices made by both parties, Taiwan will eventually realize that it is an inseparable part of China. For I believe in my beliefs, I embrace those with different beliefs, and hope for the best for all.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tThe author is a student of the New York University.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2017/1221/c90000-9307098.html'}\n"

cherish our own lives, respect and protect nature, and safeguard the irreplaceable planet Earth.\\n\\n\\tNEW MODEL OF PARTY-TO-PARTY RELATIONS\\n\\n\\tXi proposed to develop a new model of

parties to China for exchanges, Xi said.\\n\\n\\tXi also suggested that the CPC in Dialogue with World Political Parties High-Level Meeting be institutionalized and developed into a high-level political dialogue platform of broad representation and international influence.\\n\\n\\tThe CPC has kept regular contacts with more than 400 political parties and organizations in about 160 countries

the law of social development for humanity and share it with other countries, according to Xi.\\n\\n\\tHe said that the CPC will, as always, contribute to world peace.\\n\\n\\tNoting that one of the founding missions of the CPC, established in 1921, was to end the plight of the country which had suffered long period of war and to ensure the people\\'s survival, Xi stressed that the CPC \"knows deeply the value of peace and holds firm resolve in maintaining peace.\"\\n\\n\\tTo date, China has dispatched over 36,000 peacekeeping personnel and the country is acting as a major peacekeeping force and contributor of funds for UN peacekeeping missions.\\n\\n\\tThere are currently more than 2,500 Chinese peacekeepers on UN missions in eight locations, safeguarding local peace and tranquility, despite difficulties and dangers.\\n\\n\\tHe pledged that no matter what stage of development it reaches, China will never seek hegemony or engage in expansion.\\n\\n\\tAlso, the CPC will

(Xinhua/Liu Weibing)\\n\\n\\tBEIJING, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said the CPC is willing to work with other political parties around the world to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind and create a better world.\\n\\n\\tXi made the remarks while delivering a keynote speech on Friday at the opening ceremony of CPC in Dialogue with World Political Parties High-Level Meeting in Beijing.\\n\\n\\tBUILDING COMMUNITY WITH SHARED FUTURE FOR MANKIND\\n\\n\\tXi said the initiative of building a community with a shared future for mankind is being transformed from a concept into action.\\n\\n\\t\"I\\'m delighted to see that the friendly cooperation between China and other countries is increasingly expanding and the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind is gaining support and endorsement from an increasing number of people,\" Xi said.\\n\\n\\tThe concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind was put forth by Xi in 2013.\\n\\n\\tThe Belt and Road Initiative is the practice of the concept, Xi said, adding the initiative has become a huge cooperation platform for countries concerned to realize their common development.\\n\\n\\tProposed by Xi in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative aims to build trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe and Africa via land and maritime routes.\\n\\n\\tIn his speech, Xi said building a community with a shared future for mankind is in essence to connect the prospects and destinies of every nation and country closely together, share weal and woe, and turn planet Earth into a harmonious family.\\n\\n\\tHe said efforts shall be made to build a safe world free of fear, adding a country cannot gain its security at the cost of others\\'. Threats facing other countries may be challenges to ourselves.\\n\\n\\t\"Facing increasingly complicated and integrated threats, we shall not fight alone, nor shall we worship military force,\" he said, adding all countries should pursue a new concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security.\\n\\n\\tAll countries should create fair, just and shared security to jointly eliminate the root cause of war and rescue people from pains brought about by war, he said.\\n\\n\\tIn the meantime, countries should also strive to eliminate poverty and promote common prosperity, Xi said, citing challenges such as the North-South development gap, poverty, hunger and digital gap.\\n\\n\\tThe old-school winner-takes-all mentality and beggar-thy-neighbor approach would not only block the doors of others, but also barricade one\\'s own path. \"They would erode a country\\'s own roots for growth, and impair the future of whole humanity,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tThe world should push for an economic globalization that is more open and inclusive, more balanced, more equitable and beneficial to all, to bring prosperity to all countries and create comfortable lives for children worldwide, he noted.\\n\\n\\tXi went on to emphasize the significance of an open and inclusive world, urging the world to break cultural barriers and let all kinds of civilizations exist and grow in harmony.\\n\\n\\tStressing the building of a clean and beautiful world with picturesque scenery, Xi called for efforts to ensure coexistence between man and nature, cherish the environment as we cherish our own lives, respect and protect nature, and safeguard the irreplaceable planet Earth.\\n\\n\\tNEW MODEL OF PARTY-TO-PARTY RELATIONS\\n\\n\\tXi proposed to develop a new model of party-to-party relations, in which political parties seek common grounds while shelving differences, respect and learn from one another.\\n\\n\\tPolitical parties of different countries should work together for an international network of cooperation and exchange in various forms and at multiple levels, he said.\\n\\n\\tWith an open vision and broad mind, the CPC is willing to carry out dialogues, exchanges and cooperation with peoples and political parties of other countries, he noted.\\n\\n\\tIn the next five years, the CPC would like to invite 15,000 members of foreign political parties to China for exchanges, Xi said.\\n\\n\\tXi also suggested that the CPC in Dialogue with World Political Parties High-Level Meeting be institutionalized and developed into a high-level political dialogue platform of broad representation and international influence.\\n\\n\\tThe CPC has kept regular contacts with more than 400 political parties and organizations in about 160 countries and regions.\\n\\n\\tCHINA WILL NOT \"EXPORT\" CHINESE MODEL\\n\\n\\tXi said the CPC would neither import foreign models of development nor export the Chinese model.\\n\\n\\t\"We will not ask other countries to copy the Chinese practice,\" he added.\\n\\n\\tHe reiterated that the CPC strives for both the well-being of the Chinese people and human progress.\\n\\n\\tTherefore, besides taking care of China\\'s internal matters, the CPC will create opportunities for the world through China\\'s development, said Xi.\\n\\n\\tThe CPC, as the biggest political party in the world, will also explore the law of social development for humanity and share it with other countries, according to Xi.\\n\\n\\tHe said that the CPC will, as always, contribute to world peace.\\n\\n\\tNoting that one of the founding missions of the CPC, established in 1921, was to end the plight of the country which had suffered long period of war and to ensure the people\\'s survival, Xi stressed that the CPC \"knows deeply the value of peace and holds firm resolve in maintaining peace.\"\\n\\n\\tTo date, China has dispatched over 36,000 peacekeeping personnel and the country is acting as a major peacekeeping

(Xinhua/Ju Peng)\\n\\n\\tXIAMEN, Sept. 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping has shared his vision for the BRICS cooperation which he believes will enter a second \"golden decade\" if the emerging-market countries work together to overcome the challenges of weak growth and threats to world peace.\\n\\n\\tAddressing the BRICS Business Forum in Xiamen on Sunday, with Brazilian President Michel Temer and South African President Jacob Zuma in audience, Xi said after ten years a fully-fledged BRICS cooperation framework is taking shape.\\n\\n\\tWith Russia\\'s Vladimir Putin and India\\'s Narendra Modi joining in, the leaders of the world\\'s five major developing countries will chart way forward for the bloc at the ninth BRICS summit scheduled for Sept. 3-5.\\n\\n\\tXi on Sunday refuted the assertion that BRICS is losing luster.\\n\\n\\tHe said despite headwinds causing growth setbacks, the BRICS countries are \"fully confident\" about their growth potential and the future outlook.\\n\\n\\tTANGIBLE BENEFITS\\n\\n\\tBRIC was first coined in 2001 to describe four emerging economies with fast growth and great potential. The concept turned into a formal cooperation framework in 2006. Four years later, South Africa joined. BRIC became BRICS.\\n\\n\\tXi said the past decade has seen the BRICS countries making headway in pursuing common development. Their combined GDP grew 179 percent, trade increased 94 percent and urban population expanded 28 percent during the period.\\n\\n\\tThe development of the BRICS countries over the past decade has delivered tangible benefits to more than 3 billion people.\\n\\n\\tXi said three important practices of the shared value should be carried forward -- treating each other as equals, seeking results-oriented cooperation, and bearing in mind the well-being of the world.\\n\\n\\t\"Dialogue without confrontation, partnership without alliance,\" Xi summed up the cooperation principle in a simple phrase.\\n\\n\\tHe said the principle has gained growing endorsement and has become a positive energy in the international community.\\n\\n\\tRISING UP TO CHALLENGES\\n\\n\\tThe Chinese president said the global economy remains in a period of adjustment featuring weak growth and no apparent new drivers.

This is indeed a gathering of great minds. In the coming two days, I hope that by engaging in full exchanges of views, we will contribute to pursuing the Belt and Road Initiative, a project of the century, so that it will benefit people across the world.\\n\\n\\tLadies and Gentlemen,\\n\\n\\tDear Friends,\\n\\n\\tOver 2,000 years ago, our ancestors, trekking across vast steppes and deserts, opened the transcontinental passage connecting Asia, Europe and Africa, known today as the Silk Road. Our ancestors, navigating rough seas, created sea routes linking the East with the West, namely, the maritime Silk Road. These ancient silk routes opened windows of friendly engagement among nations, adding a splendid chapter to the history of human progress. The thousand-year-old \"gilt bronze silkworm\" displayed at China\\'s Shaanxi History Museum and the Belitung shipwreck discovered in Indonesia bear witness to this exciting period of history.\\n\\n\\tSpanning thousands of miles and years, the ancient silk routes embody the spirit of peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit. The Silk Road spirit has become a great heritage of human civilization.\\n\\n\\t-- Peace and cooperation. In China\\'s Han Dynasty around 140 B.C., Zhang Qian, a royal emissary, left Chang\\'an, capital of the Han Dynasty. He traveled westward on a mission of peace and opened an overland route linking the East and the West, a daring undertaking which came to be known as Zhang Qian\\'s journey to the Western regions. Centuries later, in the years of Tang, Song and Yuan Dynasties, such silk routes, both over land and at sea, boomed. Great adventurers, including Du Huan of China, Marco Polo of Italy and ibn Batutah of Morocco, left their footprints along these ancient routes. In the early 15th century, Zheng He, the famous Chinese navigator in the Ming Dynasty, made seven voyages to the Western Seas, a feat which still is remembered today. These pioneers won their place in history not as conquerors with warships, guns or swords. Rather, they are remembered as friendly emissaries leading camel caravans and sailing treasure-loaded ships. Generation after generation, the silk routes travelers have built a bridge for peace and East-West cooperation.\\n\\n\\t-- Openness and inclusiveness. The ancient silk routes spanned the valleys of the Nile, the Tigris and Euphrates, the Indus and Ganges and the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers. They connected the birthplaces of the Egyptian, Babylonian, Indian and Chinese civilizations as well as the lands of Buddhism, Christianity and Islam and homes of people of different nationalities and races. These routes enabled people of various civilizations, religions and races to interact with and embrace each other with open mind. In the course of exchange, they fostered a spirit of mutual respect and were engaged in a common endeavor to pursue prosperity. Today, ancient cities of Jiuquan, Dunhuang, Tulufan, Kashi, Samarkand, Baghdad and Constantinople as well as ancient ports of Ningbo, Quanzhou, Guangzhou, Beihai, Colombo, Jeddah and Alexandria stand as living monuments to these past interactions. This part of history shows that civilization thrives with openness and nations prosper through exchange.\\n\\n\\t-- Mutual learning. The ancient silk routes were not for trade only, they boosted flow of knowledge as well. Through these routes, Chinese silk, porcelain, lacquerwork and ironware were shipped to the West, while pepper, flax, spices, grape and pomegranate entered China. Through these routes, Buddhism, Islam and Arab astronomy, calendar and medicine found their way to China, while China\\'s four great inventions and silkworm breeding spread to other parts of the world. More importantly, the exchange of goods and know-how spurred new ideas. For example, Buddhism originated in India, blossomed in China and was enriched in Southeast Asia. Confucianism, which was born in China, gained appreciation by European thinkers such as Leibniz and Voltaire. Herein lies the appeal of mutual learning.\\n\\n\\t-- Mutual benefit. The ancient silk routes witnessed the bustling scenes of visits and trade over land and ships calling at ports. Along these major arteries of interaction, capital, technology and people flowed freely, and goods, resources and benefits were widely shared. The ancient prosperous cities of Alma-Ata, Samarkand and Chang\\'an and ports of Sur and Guangzhou thrived, so did the Roman Empire as well as Parthia and Kushan Kingdoms. The Han and Tang Dynasties of China entered the golden age. The ancient silk routes brought prosperity to these regions and boosted their development.\\n\\n\\tHistory is our best teacher. The glory of the ancient silk routes shows that geographical distance is not insurmountable. If we take the first courageous step towards each other, we can embark on a path leading to friendship, shared development, peace, harmony and a better future.\\n\\n\\tLadies and Gentlemen,\\n\\n\\tDear Friends,\\n\\n\\tFrom the historical perspective, humankind has reached an age of great progress, great transformation and profound changes. In this increasingly multi-polar, economically globalized, digitized and culturally diversified world, the trend toward peace and development becomes stronger, and reform and innovation are gaining momentum. Never have we seen such close interdependence among countries as today, such fervent desire of people for a better life, and never have we had so many means to prevail over difficulties.\\n\\n\\tIn terms of reality, we find ourselves in a world fraught with challenges. Global growth requires new drivers, development needs to be more inclusive and balanced, and the gap between the rich and the poor needs to be narrowed. Hotspots in some regions are causing instability and terrorism is rampant. Deficit in peace, development and governance poses a daunting challenge to mankind. This is the issue that has always been on my mind.\\n\\n\\tIn the autumn of 2013, respectively in Kazakhstan and Indonesia, I proposed the building of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which I call the Belt and Road Initiative. As a Chinese saying goes, \"Peaches and plums do not speak, but they are so attractive that a path is formed below the trees.\" Four years on, over 100 countries and international organizations have supported and got involved in this initiative. Important resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly and Security Council contain reference to it. Thanks to our efforts, the vision of the Belt and Road Initiative is becoming a reality and bearing rich fruit.\\n\\n\\t-- These four years have seen deepened policy connectivity. I have said on many occasions that the pursuit of the Belt and Road Initiative is not meant to reinvent the wheel. Rather, it aims to complement the development strategies of countries involved by leveraging their comparative strengths. We have enhanced coordination with the policy initiatives of relevant countries, such as the Eurasian Economic Union of Russia, the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity, the Bright Road initiative of Kazakhstan, the Middle Corridor initiative of Turkey, the Development Road initiative of Mongolia, the Two Corridors, One Economic Circle initiative of Viet Nam, the Northern Powerhouse initiative of the UK and the Amber Road initiative of Poland. We are also promoting complementarity between China\\'s development plan and those of Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Hungary and other countries. China has signed cooperation agreements with over 40 countries and international organizations and carried out framework cooperation on production capacity with more than 30 countries. During the forum, a number of cooperation agreements on policy connectivity and action plans will be signed. We will also launch Belt and Road cooperation initiative on trade connectivity together with some 60 countries and international organizations. Such policy connectivity will produce a multiplying effect on cooperation among the parties involved.\\n\\n\\t-- These four years have seen enhanced infrastructure connectivity. Building roads and railways creates prosperity in all sectors. We have accelerated the building of Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, China-Laos railway, Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway and Hungary-Serbia railway, and upgraded Gwadar and Piraeus ports in cooperation with relevant countries. A large number of connectivity projects are also in the pipeline. Today, a multi-dimensional infrastructure network is taking shape, one that is underpinned by economic corridors such as China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor and the New Eurasian Continental Bridge, featuring land-sea-air transportation routes and information expressway and supported by major railway, port and pipeline projects.\\n\\n\\t-- These four years have seen increased trade connectivity. China has worked with other countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative to promote trade and investment facilitation and improve business environment. I was told that for Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries alone, customs clearance time for agricultural produce exporting to China is cut by 90%. Total trade between China and other Belt and Road countries in 2014-2016 has exceeded US$3 trillion, and China\\'s investment in these countries has surpassed US$50 billion. Chinese companies have set up 56 economic cooperation zones in over 20 countries, generating some US$1.1 billion of tax revenue and 180,000 jobs for them.\\n\\n\\t-- These four years have seen expanded financial connectivity. Financing bottleneck is a key challenge to realizing connectivity. China has engaged in multiple forms of financial cooperation with countries and organizations involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has provided US$1.7 billion of loans for 9 projects in Belt and Road participating countries. The Silk Road Fund has made US$4 billion of investment, and the 16+1 financial holding company between China and Central and Eastern European countries has been inaugurated. With distinctive focus, these new financial mechanisms and traditional multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank complement each other. A multi-tiered Belt and Road financial cooperation network has taken an initial shape.\\n\\n\\t-- These four years have seen strengthened people-to-people connectivity. Friendship, which derives from close contact between the people, holds the key to sound state-to-state relations. Guided by the Silk Road spirit, we the Belt and Road Initiative participating countries have pulled our efforts to build the educational Silk Road and the health Silk Road, and carried out cooperation in science, education, culture, health and people-to-people exchange. Such cooperation has helped lay a solid popular and social foundation for pursuing the Belt and Road Initiative. Every year, the Chinese government provides 10,000 government scholarships to the relevant countries. China\\'s local governments have also set up special Silk Road scholarships to encourage international cultural and educational exchanges. Projects of people-to-people cooperation such as Silk Road culture year, tourism year, art festival, film and TV project, seminar and think tank dialogue are flourishing. These interactions have brought our people increasingly closer.\\n\\n\\tThese fruitful outcomes show that the Belt and Road Initiative responds to the trend of the times, conforms to the law of development, and meets the people\\'s interests. It surely has broad prospects.\\n\\n\\tLadies and Gentlemen,\\n\\n\\tDear Friends,\\n\\n\\tAs we often say in China, \"The beginning is the most difficult part.\" A solid first step has been taken in pursuing the Belt and Road Initiative. We should build on the sound momentum generated to steer the Belt and Road Initiative toward greater success. In pursuing this endeavor, we should be guided by the following principles:\\n\\n\\tFirst, we should build the Belt and Road into a road for peace. The ancient silk routes thrived in times of peace, but lost vigor in times of war. The pursuit of the Belt and Road Initiative requires a peaceful and stable environment. We should foster a new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation; and we should forge partnerships of dialogue with no confrontation and of friendship rather than alliance. All countries should respect each other\\'s sovereignty, dignity and territorial integrity, each other\\'s development paths and social systems, and each other\\'s core interests and major concerns.\\n\\n\\tSome regions along the ancient Silk Road used to be a land of milk and honey. Yet today, these places are often associated with conflict, turbulence, crisis and challenge. Such state of affairs should not be allowed to continue. We should foster the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and create a security environment built and shared by all. We should work to resolve hotspot issues through political means, and promote mediation in the spirit of justice. We should intensify counter-terrorism efforts, address both its symptoms and root causes, and strive to eradicate poverty, backwardness and social injustice.\\n\\n\\tSecond, we should build the Belt and Road into a road of prosperity. Development holds the master key to solving all problems. In pursuing the Belt and Road Initiative, we should focus on the fundamental issue of development, release the growth potential of various countries and achieve economic integration and interconnected development and deliver benefits to all.\\n\\n\\tIndustries are the foundation of economy. We should deepen industrial cooperation so that industrial development plans of different countries will complement and reinforce each other. Focus should be put on launching major projects. We should strengthen international cooperation on production capacity and equipment manufacturing, and seize new development opportunities presented by the new industrial revolution to foster new businesses and maintain dynamic growth.\\n\\n\\tFinance is the lifeblood of modern economy. Only when the blood circulates smoothly can one grow. We should establish a stable and sustainable financial safeguard system that keeps risks under control, create new models of investment and financing, encourage greater cooperation between government and private capital and build a diversified financing system and a multi-tiered capital market. We should also develop inclusive finance and improve financial services networks.\\n\\n\\tInfrastructure connectivity is the foundation of development through cooperation. We should promote land, maritime, air and cyberspace connectivity, concentrate our efforts on key passageways, cities and projects and connect networks of highways, railways and sea ports. The goal of building six major economic corridors under the Belt and Road Initiative has been set, and we should endeavor to meet it. We need to seize opportunities presented by the new round of change in energy mix and the revolution in energy technologies to develop global energy interconnection and achieve green and low-carbon development. We should improve trans-regional logistics network and promote connectivity of policies, rules and standards so as to provide institutional safeguards for enhancing connectivity.\\n\\n\\tThird, we should build the Belt and Road into a road of opening up. Opening up brings progress while isolation results in backwardness. For a country, opening up is like the struggle of a chrysalis breaking free from its cacoon. There will be short-term pains, but such pains will create a new life. The Belt and Road Initiative should be an open one that will achieve both economic growth and balanced development.\\n\\n\\tWe should build an open platform of cooperation and uphold and grow an open world economy. We should jointly create an environment that will facilitate opening up and development, establish a fair, equitable and transparent system of international trade and investment rules and boost the orderly flow of production factors, efficient resources allocation and full market integration. We welcome efforts made by other countries to grow open economies based on their national conditions, participate in global governance and provide public goods. Together, we can build a broad community of shared interests.\\n\\n\\tTrade is an important engine driving growth. We should embrace the outside world with an open mind, uphold the multilateral trading regime, advance the building of free trade areas and promote liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment. Of course, we should also focus on resolving issues such as imbalances in development, difficulties in governance, digital divide and income disparity and make economic globalization open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.\\n\\n\\tFourth, we should build the Belt and Road into a road of innovation. Innovation is an important force powering development. The Belt and Road Initiative is new by nature and we need to encourage innovation in pursuing this initiative.\\n\\n\\tWe should pursue innovation-driven development and intensify cooperation in frontier areas such as digital economy, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and quantum computing, and advance the development of big data, cloud computing and smart cities so as to turn them into a digital silk road of the 21st century. We should spur the full integration of science and technology into industries and finance, improve the environment for innovation and pool resources for innovation. We should create space and build workshops for young people of various countries to cultivate entrepreneurship in this age of the internet and help realize their dreams.\\n\\n\\tWe should pursue the new vision of green development and a way of life and work that is green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable. Efforts should be made to strengthen cooperation in ecological and environmental protection and build a sound ecosystem so as to realize the goals set by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\\n\\n\\tFifth, we should build the Belt and Road into a road connecting different civilizations. In pursuing the Belt and Road Initiative, we should ensure that when it comes to different civilizations, exchange will replace estrangement, mutual learning will replace clashes, and coexistence will replace a sense of superiority. This will boost mutual understanding, mutual respect and mutual trust among different countries.\\n\\n\\tWe should establish a multi-tiered mechanism for cultural and people-to-people exchanges, build more cooperation platforms and open more cooperation channels. Educational cooperation should be boosted, more exchange students should be encouraged and the performance of cooperatively run schools should be enhanced. Think tanks should play a better role and efforts should be made to establish think tank networks and partnerships. In the cultural, sports and health sectors, new cooperation models should be created to facilitate projects with concrete benefits. Historical and cultural heritage should be fully tapped to jointly develop tourist products and protect heritage in ways that preserve the distinctive features of the Silk Road. We should strengthen exchanges between parliaments, political parties and non-governmental organizations of different countries as well as between women, youths and people with disabilities with a view to achieving inclusive development. We should also strengthen international counter-corruption cooperation so that the Belt and Road will be a road with high ethical standards.\\n\\n\\tLadies and Gentlemen,\\n\\n\\tDear Friends,\\n\\n\\tChina has reached a new starting point in its development endeavors. Guided by the vision of innovative, coordinated, green, open and inclusive development, we will adapt to and steer the new normal of economic development and seize opportunities it presents. We will actively promote supply-side structural reform to achieve sustainable development, inject strong impetus into the Belt and Road Initiative and create new opportunities for global development.\\n\\n\\t-- China will enhance friendship and cooperation with all countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. We are ready to share practices of development with other countries, but we have no intention to interfere in other countries\\' internal affairs, export our own social system and model of development, or impose our own will on others. In pursuing the Belt and Road Initiative, we will not resort to outdated geopolitical maneuvering. What we hope to achieve is a new model of win-win cooperation. We have no intention to form a small group detrimental to stability, what we hope to create is a big family of harmonious co-existence.\\n\\n\\t-- China has reached practical cooperation agreements with many countries on pursuing the Belt and Road Initiative. These agreements cover not only projects of hardware connectivity, like transport, infrastructure and energy, but also software connectivity, involving telecommunications, customs and quarantine inspection. The agreements also include plans and projects for cooperation in economy and trade, industry, e-commerce, marine and green economy. The Chinese railway authorities will sign agreements with their counterparts of related countries to deepen cooperation on China-Europe regular railway cargo service. We will work to launch these cooperation projects at an early date and see that they deliver early benefits.\\n\\n\\t-- China will scale up financing support for the Belt and Road Initiative by contributing an additional RMB 100 billion to the Silk Road Fund, and we encourage financial institutions to conduct overseas RMB fund business with an estimated amount of about RMB 300 billion. The China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China will set up special lending schemes respectively worth RMB 250 billion equivalent and RMB 130 billion equivalent to support Belt and Road cooperation on infrastructure, industrial capacity and financing. We will also work with the AIIB, the BRICS New Development Bank, the World Bank and other multilateral development institutions to support Belt and Road related projects. We will work with other parties concerned to jointly formulate guidelines for financing the Belt and Road related development projects.\\n\\n\\t-- China will endeavor to build a win-win business partnership with other countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, enhance trade and investment facilitation with them, and build a Belt and Road free trade network. These efforts are designed to promote growth both in our respective regions and globally. During this forum, China will sign business and trade cooperation agreements with over 30 countries and enter into consultation on free trade agreements with related countries. China will host the China International Import Expo starting from 2018.\\n\\n\\t-- China will enhance cooperation on innovation with other countries. We will launch the Belt and Road Science, Technology and Innovation Cooperation Action Plan, which consists of the Science and Technology People-to-People Exchange Initiative, the Joint Laboratory Initiative, the Science Park Cooperation Initiative and the Technology Transfer Initiative. In the coming five years, we will offer 2,500 short-term research visits to China for young foreign scientists, train 5,000 foreign scientists, engineers and managers, and set up 50 joint laboratories. We will set up a big data service platform on ecological and environmental protection. We propose the establishment of an international coalition for green development on the Belt and Road, and we will provide support to related countries in adapting to climate change.\\n\\n\\t-- In the coming three years, China will provide assistance worth RMB 60 billion to developing countries and international organizations participating in the Belt and Road Initiative to launch more projects to improve people\\'s well-being. We will provide emergency food aid worth RMB 2 billion to developing countries along the Belt and Road and make an additional contribution of US$1 billion to the Assistance Fund for South-South Cooperation. China will launch 100 \"happy home\" projects, 100 poverty alleviation projects and 100 health care and rehabilitation projects in countries along the Belt and Road. China will provide relevant international organizations with US$1 billion to implement cooperation projects that will benefit the countries along the Belt and Road.\\n\\n\\t-- China will put in place the following mechanisms to boost Belt and Road cooperation: a liaison office for the Forum\\'s follow-up activities, the Research Center for the Belt and Road Financial and Economic Development, the Facilitating Center for Building the Belt and Road, the Multilateral Development Financial Cooperation Center in cooperation with multilateral development banks, and an IMF-China Capacity Building Center. We will also develop a network for cooperation among the NGOs in countries along the Belt and Road as well as new people-to-people exchange platforms such as a Belt and Road news alliance and a music education alliance.\\n\\n\\tThe Belt and Road Initiative is rooted in the ancient Silk Road. It focuses on the Asian, European and African continents, but is also open to all other countries. All countries, from either Asia, Europe, Africa or the Americas, can be international cooperation partners of the Belt and Road Initiative. The pursuit of this initiative is based on extensive consultation and its benefits will be shared by us all.\\n\\n\\tLadies and Gentlemen,\\n\\n\\tDear Friends,\\n\\n\\tAn ancient Chinese saying goes, \"A long journey can be covered only by taking one step at a time\". Similarly, there is an Arab proverb which says that the Pyramid was built by piling one stone on another. In Europe, there is also the saying that \"Rome wasn\\'t built in a day.\" The Belt and Road Initiative is a great undertaking which requires dedicated efforts. Let us pursue this initiative step by step and deliver outcome one by one. By doing so, we will bring true benefit to both the world and all our people!\\n\\n\\tIn conclusion, I wish the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation a full success!\\n\\n\\tThank you!', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2017/0515/c90000-9215493.html'}\n"

But Chinese industries, especially those that have been targeted by US protectionist measures, remain cautious.\\n\\n\\t\"This is a positive development for Sino-US relations, but Chinese aluminum companies don\\'t have much expectations,\" Xiong Hui, chief analyst at aluminum industry research firm Antaike, told the Global Times on Thursday.\\n\\n\\tTrade friction\\n\\n\\tThe US has been targeting Chinese aluminum products. As recently as Tuesday, the US Department of Commerce launched anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations into Chinese aluminum foil.\\n\\n\\tThe situation is similar for the automobile industry, which has also been subjected to US protectionist measures, Zeng Zhiling, an analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy LMC Automotives, said.\\n\\n\\t\"The US has been targeting Chinese auto parts for years, and we don\\'t think that attitude will immediately change,\" Zeng told the Global Times.\\n\\n\\tThe US is investigating China-made tires and other auto parts in anti-dumping cases.

      "757,{'發稿日': ['March18', '2017'], '新聞標題': 'Full Text: Work report of NPC Standing Committee', '作者': 'Xinhua', '新聞內文': 'BEIJING, March 18 -- Following is the full text of the Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People\\'s Congress (NPC), which was delivered by Chairman Zhang Dejiangof the NPC Standing Committee on March 8, 2017 for deliberation at the Fifth Session of the Twelfth National People\\'s Congress and adopted on March 15, 2017:\\n\\n\\tREPORT ON THE WORK OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE\\'S CONGRESS\\n\\n\\tDelivered at the Fifth Session of the Twelfth National People\\'s Congress on March 8, 2017\\n\\n\\tZhang Dejiang\\n\\n\\tChairman of the Standing Committee of the National People\\'s Congress\\n\\n\\tFellow Deputies,\\n\\n\\tOn behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People\\'s Congress (NPC), I will now present to you the report on the work of the Standing Committee for your deliberation.\\n\\n\\tMajor Initiatives of the Past Year\\n\\n\\tOver the past year, under the firm leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Xi Jinpingat its core, the NPC Standing Committee has comprehensively implemented the guidelines from the 18th National Party Congress and those of the third through sixth plenary sessions of the 18th Party Central Committee; followed the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development; and carefully studied and put into practice the principles from General Secretary Xi Jinping\\'s major addresses and his new vision, thinking, and strategies for the governance of China. We have upheld our commitment to integrating leadership by the Party, the position of the people as masters of the country, and law-based governance, and have exercised the functions and powers granted to us by the Constitution and other laws and worked hard in our role as the country\\'s highest organ of state power, focusing closely on the overall plan for balanced economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological progress, on the coordinated advancement of the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy,(1) and on the implementation of the new development philosophy.\\n\\n\\tUpholding leadership by the Party is the foundation and lifeblood of both the Party and the country and affects the interests and wellbeing of all the people of China. At its Sixth Plenary Session, the 18th Party Central Committee formally affirmed that General Secretary Xi Jinping is at the core of the Central Committee and of the entire Party, reflecting the will of all members of the Party, all members of the armed forces, and all the people of China. We have built a keen awareness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, uphold the leadership core, and keep in alignment; closely followed the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core in terms of thinking, political stand, and action; upheld the centralized, unified leadership of the Central Committee and resolutely safeguarded its authority; and worked to see that the line, principles, and policies of the Party as well as the decisions and plans of the Party Central Committee are carried out in the NPC\\'s work.\\n\\n\\tSince the Fourth Session of the 12th NPC, the Standing Committee has enacted 8 laws, revised 27 laws, passed 7 decisions or resolutions on legal issues, issued 1 legal interpretation, and resolved to present the draft of 1 law and 3 draft decisions on legal issues to this session of the NPC for deliberation. Our legislative work has continued to be characterized by the great number, importance, and pace of activities, and we have further improved the quality of the NPC\\'s legislative work.\\n\\n\\tWe inspected compliance with 6 laws; heard and deliberated 20 work reports from the State Council, the Supreme People\\'s Court, and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate; passed 2 resolutions; and conducted 3 special inquiries and 5 research projects. Through these activities, we have achieved continuous progress in the NPC\\'s oversight work, making it more targeted and effective.\\n\\n\\tWe deliberated and approved 8 reports from the NPC\\'s special committees regarding their examination of deputies\\' proposals, as well as 7 reports from the Credentials Committee pertaining to its review of certain deputies\\' qualifications. We ratified 3 treaties and agreements concluded between China and foreign countries as well as China\\'s accession to 4 international conventions, and made decisions on or gave approval to the appointment or removal of a number of officials of state bodies. New advances and achievements have been made in every area of the NPC\\'s work.\\n\\n\\t1. We worked hard to advance legislation in key areas and improve the quality of legislation.\\n\\n\\tEffective legislation is a prerequisite and foundation for China\\'s law-based governance. Continuing to make legislation our top priority, we focused on major legislative items important to China\\'s reform, development, and stability, gave great attention to the key task of raising the quality of our legislation, and enacted a number of important laws.\\n\\n\\t1) Major progress was made in developing the system of national security laws.\\n\\n\\tNational security is the foundation of a stable country. Putting into effect the integrative national security concept and giving central consideration to China\\'s conditions and realities, we maintained our political resolve, acted when the time was right for legislation, and worked faster to develop the system of laws related to national security. Following the enactment of the Counter-Espionage Law in 2014 and the National Security Law and the Anti-Terrorism Law in 2015, last year we deliberated and passed the Law on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organizations in the Mainland of China, the Cybersecurity Law, and the Law on National Defense Transportation, and deliberated the drafts of an intelligence law and a nuclear safety law.\\n\\n\\tThe Law on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organizations in the Mainland of China brings the administration of activities of overseas NGOs in the mainland of China into line with the rule of law. It will help to protect their legitimate rights and interests and promote exchange and cooperation, while also helping to strengthen China\\'s law-based oversight and regulation and safeguard China\\'s national security and public interests.\\n\\n\\tThe Cybersecurity Law is a fundamental law in the field of cyber security. The law establishes basic regulatory systems for all areas of cyber security that ensure the effective utilization, sound development, law-based regulation, and improved security of cyberspace and establish the right balance between freedom and order, security and development, and national governance and international cooperation.\\n\\n\\tThe Law on National Defense Transportation is the first piece of legislation pertaining to national defense deliberated and adopted by this Standing Committee. The purpose of this law is to facilitate closer military-civilian integration in the field of transportation and improve the capabilities of national defense transportation to serve in times of peace, respond to emergencies, and meet challenges in times of war, thus better serving the country\\'s overall strategy for national security and development.\\n\\n\\t2) Steady progress was made in developing the General Provisions of Civil Law.\\n\\n\\tThe development of a civil code was an important legislative task proposed at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 18th Party Central Committee, and is a move of enormous importance for fully advancing China\\'s law-based governance and improving the socialist system of laws with Chinese characteristics. After the founding of the People\\'s Republic of China in 1949, the NPC worked on developing civil law in 1954, 1962, 1979, and 2001, but for a number of reasons efforts in 1954 and 1962 failed to produce real results. The work in 1979 and 2001, through careful consideration, led to the adoption of an incremental approach, whereby individual civil laws were to be formulated first and the civil code was to be developed later when the conditions were right to do so. To meet the needs of promoting reform and opening up and developing the socialist market economy, China formulated the General Principles of Civil Law, and introduced a series of civil laws such as the Inheritance Law, the Adoption Law, the Guarantee Law, the Contract Law, the Property Law, and the Tort Law. Now the conditions are all in place for compiling a civil code. The Standing Committee has decided to adopt a two-step approach to develop the civil code: first, developing the general part of the civil code, or the General Provisions of Civil Law; and second, following the enactment of the General Provisions of Civil Law, compiling the individual books of the civil code, striving to form a complete civil code by 2020.\\n\\n\\tThe General Provisions of Civil Law lays out the basic principles and general rules of civil law, and is the leading part of the civil code. The Standing Committee has worked with a strong sense of responsibility and mission to do its utmost to formulate the General Provisions of Civil Law, carrying out three readings to deliberate the draft legislation, and making three open requests for public comments through the NPC\\'s website (www.npc.gov.cn). After careful deliberation and repeated revisions, we have decided to submit the draft of the General Provisions of Civil Law to this session for deliberation. We believe that with the concerted efforts of all deputies, we will be able to make this a piece of legislation that stands the test of time and meets the expectations of the people, and that is characteristically Chinese, thus laying a solid foundation for the civil code.\\n\\n\\tNote: (1) This refers to making comprehensive moves to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, deepen reform, advance the law-based governance of China, and strengthen Party self-governance.\\n\\n\\t3) Legislation concerning cultural, social, environmental, and other issues was strengthened.\\n\\n\\tSeeing that China\\'s legislative work in the cultural sector was lagging behind, last year we strengthened the system of laws on culture by deliberating and passing two important laws related to this sector. The Law on Guaranteeing Public Cultural Services clarifies the duties and responsibilities of the government in the provision of public cultural services, and establishes basic principles and mechanisms for guaranteeing provision. The Film Industry Promotion Law regulates the scripting, filming, release, and showing of films and provides greater support and security for the film industry. These two laws will play a significant role in safeguarding the people\\'s basic cultural rights and interests, enriching their intellectual and cultural life, and promoting core socialist values.\\n\\n\\tTraditional Chinese medicine is a national treasure. The Law on Traditional Chinese Medicine passed after deliberation by the Standing Committee clearly stipulates: traditional Chinese medicine is the general designation for the traditional medicine of the Han and of ethnic minorities of China. The state shall work hard to develop traditional Chinese medicine, follow the principle of attaching equal importance to traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and put in place a regulatory system suitable to the unique features of traditional Chinese medicine, thereby giving full play to its role in China\\'s health care services.\\n\\n\\tIn keeping with the decisions on reform made by the Party Central Committee related to replacing environmental protection fees with a tax and ensuring law-based taxation, we deliberated and passed the Environmental Protection Tax Law. This is the first tax law deliberated and approved by this Standing Committee; it is of great importance in giving full play to the role of taxation in helping to control and reduce emissions and protect and improve ecosystems and the environment.\\n\\n\\tWe also enacted the Asset Appraisal Law and revised laws including the Law on the Promotion of Privately-Run Schools, the Wildlife Protection Law, the Marine Environment Protection Law, the Law on the Red Cross Society, and the Law on Corporate Income Tax.\\n\\n\\t4) Legislative mechanisms and methods were refined.\\n\\n\\tFirst, we published the guidelines on establishing sound systems under which special committees of the NPCand working bodies of the NPC Standing Committee organize the drafting of important laws. Of all the legislative items deliberated by the Standing Committee this past year, the drafting for 10 items was led by relevant special committees of the NPC and working bodies of the Standing Committee.\\n\\n\\tSecond, we improved the mechanisms for soliciting the opinions of deputies on the drafts of laws and invited them to participate in the research, debate, deliberation, and assessment process so as to ensure their comments and suggestions can be effectively heard and adopted. These efforts have enabled deputies to play a bigger role in the NPC\\'s legislative work.\\n\\n\\tThird, we formulated the Procedures for Collecting and Discussing Legislative Items, making progress in efforts to better standardize and institutionalize legislative work.\\n\\n\\tFourth, we improved the system for staying connected with local communities on legislative matters, and on eight occasions organized activities to solicit comments on seven draft laws from the general public and officials at the community level. This ensured that legislative work was carried out in close connection with the people and was better able to reflect public sentiment.\\n\\n\\tWe held a national symposium on local legislation to guide local legislative work, especially the legislative work of cities with subsidiary districts. Of the 273 cities and autonomous prefectures newly granted local legislative powers by the revised Legislation Law, 269 have, with approval from provincial-level people\\'s congresses, already begun to formulate local regulations.\\n\\n\\t2. We worked in accordance with the law to issue decisions on a number of major issues.\\n\\n\\tThe work of the NPC is an important part of the work of the Party and the country. We have upheld our commitment to the right political direction and to working with the big picture in mind. When faced with major issues and important matters, we demonstrated the courage to take on responsibility and the ability to fulfill duties, ensuring that the Party\\'s propositions are turned into the will of the state through statutory procedures.\\n\\n\\t1) We promptly and appropriately dealt with problems related to the case of election bribery in Liaoning Province, working resolutely to uphold the authority and sanctity of the system of people\\'s congresses.\\n\\n\\tThe voting bribery case in Liaoning Province was the first major case of its kind to have occurred at the provincial level since the founding of the People\\'s Republic of China. The perpetrators seriously violated Party discipline, state laws, and the requirements of the intra-Party electoral system and the electoral system of the people\\'s congresses. After the deputies to the Liaoning Provincial People\\'s Congress involved in the case had their qualifications revoked in accordance with relevant laws, those who were members of the Standing Committee of the Liaoning Provincial People\\'s Congress were removed from their positions in accordance with the law. The Standing Committee of the Liaoning Provincial People\\'s Congress, having had over half of its members removed, was unable to convene meetings and carry out its duties. In order to promptly and appropriately resolve this unprecedented and exceptional issue, the NPC Standing Committee acted on the basis of the Constitution and relevant legal principles to make creative institutional arrangements. At the provisionally convened 23rd meeting of the NPC Standing Committee on September 13, 2016, we deliberated and approved the report of the Credentials Committee to revoke, in accordance with the law, the qualifications of 45 NPC deputies elected by the Liaoning Provincial People\\'s Congress for bribing voters. At the meeting, we also deliberated and approved a decision stipulating that the 12th Liaoning Provincial People\\'s Congress shall set up a preparatory committee to exercise certain functions and powers on behalf of its Standing Committee and shall take charge of the preparatory work for the convocation of its Seventh Session.\\n\\n\\tOur handling of the Liaoning case in accordance with the law and Party discipline fully reflects the Party Central Committee\\'s clear stand and strong resolve for advancing China\\'s law-based governance and ensuring strict Party self-governance. No violation of our socialist democracy or rule of law in any form shall be tolerated.\\n\\n\\t2) We produced the interpretation of Article 104 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in accordance with the law to firmly oppose any attempt at secession of Hong Kong from our country.\\n\\n\\tThe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is an inseparable part of the People\\'s Republic of China. To attempt \"Hong Kong independence\" is to attempt secession, a serious violation of the \"one country, two systems\" principle, the Constitution of China, and the Basic Law of Hong Kong. The NPC Standing Committee, exercising power entrusted to it by the Constitution and the Basic Law, produced the interpretation of Article 104 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong. The interpretation clearly establishes that, as stipulated by Article 104, to \"swear to uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People\\'s Republic of China and swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People\\'s Republic of China\" is not only the exact phrasing that must be included in the oath prescribed by Article 104, but is also a legal requirement and condition for any person standing for election or taking up any position of public office specified in the Article. The interpretation clarifies the legal procedures that must be adhered to when taking the oath of office and the statutory content that must be included in the oath; it makes clear that anyone who violates this stipulation on oath taking is to be legally disqualified from assuming office and that any person who makes an oath insincerely or breaks their oath will be held legally responsible.\\n\\n\\tThis interpretation fully demonstrates the Chinese central leadership\\'s resolve in upholding the \"one country, two systems\" principle and its firm stand against any attempt at secession of Hong Kong from the Chinese nation; it embodies the firm will of 1.3 billion Chinese people, including those in the Hong Kong region, to safeguard their country\\'s sovereignty, security, and developmental interests.\\n\\n\\t3) We issued the decision on carrying out trials for reform of the national supervision system to provide a legal guarantee for this major political structural reform.\\n\\n\\tAs a major policy decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinpingat its core to improve the political structure, deepening reform of the national supervision system has a direct bearing on the big picture and is of immense and far-reaching significance for improving Party conduct, upholding integrity, and combating corruption and for modernizing China\\'s governance system and capacity for governance. In order to build up experience before advancing this major reform throughout the country, the Party Central Committee has decided to launch trials in several localities. In line with the principle that \"all major reforms must have a legal basis,\" the Chairperson\\'s Council of the NPCStanding Committee produced a proposal in accordance with the law, which was carefully deliberated by the Standing Committee and resulted in the decision to carry out trials for reforming the national supervision system in Beijing and in Shanxi and Zhejiang provinces. The decision stipulates that supervisory committees shall be established in pilot areas to exercise supervisory functions and powers; that a supervisory committee shall be created by the people\\'s congress at the same level, and be responsible to and overseen by the same-level people\\'s congress and its standing committee as well as the supervisory committee at the next level up; and that supervisory committees shall supervise the exercise of public power by all government employees in their regions in accordance with the law and within the scope of their supervisory authority. It also stipulates that the applicability of certain stipulations in the Law on Administrative Supervision, the Criminal Procedure Law, the Organic Law of the Local People\\'s Congresses and Local People\\'s Governments, and other relevant laws shall be provisionally adjusted or suspended in order to ensure law-based, orderly advancement of the pilot reform.\\n\\n\\t3. We provided a legal guarantee for relevant reforms.\\n\\n\\tIn working to bring legislation into line with China\\'s reform, we revised and improved laws related to reform in a timely manner, issued decisions on relevant pilot reforms, and heard and deliberated reports on the progress of pilot reforms. We have thus been able to ensure that reform and rule of law complement and reinforce one another.\\n\\n\\t1) We revised multiple laws using a coordinated approach, in a continued effort to support the reform of the government review and approval system.\\n\\n\\tFor specific articles from different laws that deal with similar issues or the same matter and need to be revised for the sake of a reform, our approach is to issue a decision for revisions to be made across laws by putting forward multiple drafts at the same time. This is an important method we adopt to promote the relevant reform through legislation. Over the past four years, using this approach, we have deliberated and approved 13 such revision decisions, revising 74 laws and decisions on legal issues. In 2016, we deliberated and adopted the decision to revise six laws at the same time, including the Energy Conservation Law and the Law on the Prevention and Control of Occupational Diseases, as well as the decision to revise 12 laws, including the Foreign Trade Law, the Customs Law, and the Coal Industry Law. We thus made consistent changes to their articles pertaining to government review and approval or verification of professional qualifications and related matters.\\n\\n\\t2) We issued authorization decisions in accordance with the law to provide legal basis for pilot reforms.\\n\\n\\tWe authorized the Supreme People\\'s Court and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate to pilot a system of sentence bargaining in criminal cases in 18 cities including Beijing. Meanwhile, we reviewed our experiences with the pilot project of accelerated procedures for certain criminal cases that we authorized in 2014 to be carried out in these 18 cities, and incorporated this pilot project into the pilot sentence bargaining system to expand, improve, and continue running it under the new pilot system. We heard and deliberated the mid-term report of the Supreme People\\'s Court on the pilot reform of the system of people\\'s assessors, and that of the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate on the pilot reform for the filing of public interest litigation by procuratorates. We demanded that guidance and oversight be stepped up and a comprehensive evaluation of the results of these pilot reforms be made so as to accumulate experience for revising and improving relevant laws.\\n\\n\\tIn order to ensure law-based advancement of the pilot reforms concerning a salary system for public servants based on both position and rank, incorporation of the maternity insurance into the basic medical insurance scheme, and the system of military officers, we deliberated and passed three separate decisions on making provisional adjustments to the applicability of certain stipulations in relevant laws, so as to guarantee that these pilot reforms are carried on in line with the rule of law.\\n\\n\\t3) We reviewed our experiences with pilot reforms and enabled the spread of applicable practices to more regions by revising and improving relevant laws.\\n\\n\\tWe have remained committed to advancing reform on the basis of rule of law and strengthening the rule of law through reform. For reform measures that require preliminary trials, we shall authorize the necessary trials in accordance with the law; for reform measures that have proved to be effective in practice and are ready to be applied to other regions, we shall act in a timely manner to review these measures and revise and improve relevant laws accordingly. In 2013 and 2014 we issued two decisions authorizing the State Council to make provisional adjustments to items requiring government review as prescribed by certain laws in the pilot free trade zones in Shanghai, Guangdong, Tianjin, and Fujian. After considering the motion that the State Council had put forward on the basis of its thorough review of experiences gained from the trials, last year we made a coordinated effort to revise the Law on Foreign-Funded Enterprises and three other laws at the same time. We thus elevated the reform measures tested out in pilot free trade zones into provisions of law, and correspondingly terminated the two authorization decisions.\\n\\n\\t4. We made issues of public concern the focus of our intensified efforts to inspect compliance with laws and oversee work performance.\\n\\n\\tWe earnestly exercised the oversight powers granted to us by the Constitution and other laws. While continuing to pursue a problem-oriented approach, we intensified our oversight work and adopted new oversight methods, thereby increasing its effectiveness.\\n\\n\\t1) We made strengthening law compliance inspections a top priority.\\n\\n\\tThe vitality and authority of the law lie in its implementation. In taking the strict implementation of laws as a key task in advancing the law-based governance of China, we continued to strengthen and improve inspections of compliance with laws. Over the past four years, we have carried out a total of 20 inspections. In 2016, we inspected compliance with six laws, namely the Food Safety Law, the Law on Workplace Safety, the Road Traffic Safety Law, the Environmental Protection Law, the Water Law, and the Law on Promoting the Application of Scientific and Technological Advances.\\n\\n\\tThrough practice, we have continuously deepened our understanding of the patterns that underpin the work of inspecting compliance with laws, and have developed a procedure for this work, which consists of the following six steps:\\n\\n\\tFirst, the subject of the inspection is determined. Inspections will focus on laws related to issues of pressing importance for economic and social development and of common concern among the people.\\n\\n\\tSecond, inspection is well organized. I, as Chairman, and the vice chairpersons of the Standing Committee lead inspection groups in inspecting law compliance in various localities. We make use of both inspections by the Standing Committee and inspections by local people\\'s congresses entrusted by us, so as to expand the coverage of inspection. We emphasize the importance of visiting the community level to see real conditions there, so as to ensure problems are accurately identified.\\n\\n\\tThird, a comprehensive report detailing inspection results is produced. The report should contain practical and effective suggestions and serve as an important basis on which problems can be addressed and relevant systems improved.\\n\\n\\tFourth, thorough deliberation on the inspection report is carried out. Members of the Standing Committee fully express their opinions and pool their knowledge. If necessary, a special inquiry is organized based on the deliberation, with leading officials from the State Council and its relevant departments in attendance to hear comments and answer questions.\\n\\n\\tFifth, impetus is provided to the improvement of actual work. We urge the State Council, the Supreme People\\'s Court, and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate to carefully examine and handle our inspection and deliberation results and adopt effective measures to resolve pronounced problems, with relevant special committees of the NPCexercising follow-up oversight.\\n\\n\\tSixth, the State Council, the Supreme People\\'s Court, and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate are required to report on their rectification work. We then make arrangements for deliberating their reports in view of actual conditions.\\n\\n\\tThese six steps form a complete process for carrying out oversight on the implementation of laws, enabling our oversight work to become more systematic, targeted, and effective.\\n\\n\\t2) We helped ensure the people\\'s safety in life and work.\\n\\n\\tWe inspected compliance with three laws in the field of public safety and carried out special inquiries on them. We urged governments at all levels to affirm and practice the principle of putting people first and pursuing safe development, and to work hard to guarantee food, transportation, and workplace safety.\\n\\n\\tFood is the most basic necessity of the people, and safety must be the top priority in food production. Putting into practice General Secretary Xi Jinping\\'s requirements of applying the strictest possible standards, oversight, punishment, and accountability to ensure food safety, we inspected compliance with the Food Safety Law nationwide, covering every step from farm to table. Special attention was given to key areas such as edible agricultural products and infant formula, to places where groups of people eat together such as kindergartens and schools, to weak links in food safety oversight and supervision, and to prominent problems in the regulation of food vendors, small-scale food production sites, and online food ordering. On the basis of the inspection, we put forward responsible suggestions and comments to help ensure that every bite of food is safe. Giving earnest consideration to our comments and suggestions, the State Council developed the National Plan for the 13th Five-Year Plan Period for Food Safety. Local authorities also acted promptly to strengthen their oversight institutions and capability for ensuring food safety, and adopted strong measures to tackle prominent problems in food production and sale. Food and drug supervisory and regulatory authorities investigated and handled 106,000 violations of laws or regulations. Public security agencies uncovered more than 8,300 food safety offences. A total of 18 provincial-level governments introduced new, or revised existing, local statutes and regulations to better regulate food production and processing by small producers and vendors.\\n\\n\\tWhen inspecting compliance with the Law on Workplace Safety, inspection groups entered mines, factory workshops, and construction sites, so as to hear firsthand what the people in the field had to say and stress the importance of never sacrificing safety for the sake of development. Based on what we learned from the inspection, we urged relevant authorities to ensure production and operations entities have fulfilled their primary responsibilities, impose in accordance with the law stringent punishments for violations of workplace safety laws or regulations, and intensify focused efforts to tackle problems in key industries and sectors.\\n\\n\\tWhen inspecting compliance with the Road Traffic Safety Law, we targeted prominent issues such as trucks being illegally modified or carrying oversized and overweight loads, electric bikes exceeding stipulated standards, and deficiencies in traffic safety facilities on rural roads. Inspection groups acquired an in-depth understanding of the situation through a variety of methods such as unannounced visits and investigations, field surveys, and questionnaires. We required that supervision and oversight over the enforcement of the law be strengthened and serious measures be taken to stop illegal production, sale, and use of vehicles.\\n\\n\\tDuring the special inquiries that followed the law compliance inspections, members of the Standing Committee had face-to-face discussions with leading officials of the State Council and its relevant departments to get to the root of the problems and discuss measures for improvement so as to ensure people\\'s safety in life and work.\\n\\n\\t3) We gave impetus to ecological and environmental conservation and improvements.\\n\\n\\tIn actively responding to the people\\'s earnest expectation for a good environment, in 2014 we comprehensively revised the Environmental Protection Law; in 2016, we inspected compliance with this law and held a special inquiry following the inspection, and for the first time, heard and deliberated the State Council\\'s report on the state of the environment and the fulfillment of environmental protection targets. We required relevant authorities to ensure full enforcement of environmental protection laws and regulations and put great effort into addressing the environmental problems which are of great concern to the people, such as air, water, and soil pollution, so that the people can really feel improvements in the environment. We urged local governments at all levels to make annual reports on the state of the environment and the fulfillment of their environmental protection targets to people\\'s congresses at the same level and their standing committees in accordance with the law, and to willingly accept oversight by people\\'s congresses and the public.\\n\\n\\tLush mountains and lucid waters are as valuable as gold and silver. We inspected compliance with the Water Law, carried out research investigations on the implementation of the Law on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution, and heard and deliberated the State Council\\'s report on the establishment and management of nature reserves. We required that the strictest possible management system for water resources be put into action, the protection of water ecosystems and management of water environments be strengthened, sustainable use of water resources be guaranteed, and efforts to protect and restore natural ecosystems be accelerated, so that we can forever keep our mountains green and our waters clear.\\n\\n\\t4) We helped to ensure steady and sound economic and social development.\\n\\n\\tWe kept firmly in mind the Party Central Committee\\'s major decisions and plans on economic work, as we worked to strengthen oversight of economic work as well as review and oversight of government budgets and final accounts. We heard and deliberated the State Council\\'s reports on the implementation of the plan for national economic and social development, on the management of state-owned assets and reform of their management system, and on scientific and technological innovation in agriculture and forestry. We inspected the implementation of the Law on Promoting the Application of Scientific and Technological Advances. We emphasized that the government should adapt to, approach in the right way, and steer the new normal in economic development; press ahead with supply-side structural reform; ensure substantive progress in cutting overcapacity, reducing excess inventory, deleveraging, lowering costs, and strengthening areas of weakness; put great effort into pursuing innovation-driven development; work quickly to replace old drivers of growth with new ones; effectively guard against and defuse risks; and ensure a good start to the 13th Five-Year Plan.\\n\\n\\tWe heard and deliberated the State Council\\'s reports on the final accounts of the central government, on budget implementation, and on auditing work, and examined and approved the 2015 central government final accounts and the revision of the 2016 central government budget. We heard and deliberated the State Council\\'s reports on the rectification of problems discovered in auditing and on the progress achieved in deepening reform of the system of transfer payments. We required that the proactive fiscal policy be well implemented, reform of fiscal and tax systems and relevant legislative initiatives be accelerated, the compilation and management of budgets and final accounts be put under standard procedures, the effectiveness and transparency of transfer payments be raised, and management of local government debt be strengthened. To see greater participation of deputies and the public in the work of budget review, we formulated the guidelines on establishing a mechanism for soliciting opinions from deputies and people from all sectors of society before government budgets are reviewed.\\n\\n\\tWe also heard and deliberated the State Council\\'s reports on the progress of the reform and development of higher education and on the enforcement of the Law on Entry and Exit Administration. We conducted research on the development and implementation of supporting rules and regulations for the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy.\\n\\n\\t5) We worked hard to promote the spirit of the Constitution.\\n\\n\\tWe comprehensively implemented the system of pledging allegiance to the Constitution. We organized, in accordance with the law, six ceremonies for 25 officials to publicly pledge allegiance to the Constitution when they took office, demonstrating the sanctity and authority of the Constitution. On the occasion of the third National Constitution Day, and the opening of a history exhibition hall for the 1954 Constitution in Hangzhou, General Secretary Xi Jinpinggave important instructions, stressing that raising public awareness of the Constitution is an important task in advancing the law-based governance of China. The General Office of the NPCStanding Committee, together with relevant departments of the central authorities and the Standing Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial People\\'s Congress, organized a National Constitution Day seminar in Hangzhou to spread knowledge of the Constitution and promote its implementation.\\n\\n\\tWe heard and deliberated the State Council\\'s report on the implementation of the resolution on the sixth five-year initiative to popularize knowledge of the law, and adopted a resolution on launching the seventh five-year initiative to raise public awareness of the rule of law. We required that great effort be made to understand and communicate General Secretary Xi Jinping\\'s major expositions on comprehensively advancing the law-based governance of China, give play to the role of the \"critical minority\" consisting of leading officials in promoting the practice of respecting, studying, abiding by, and applying the law throughout society and particularly among public servants, and affirm the authority of the Constitution and other laws.\\n\\n\\tAttaching great importance to ensuring judicial impartiality, we heard and deliberated the report of the Supreme People\\'s Court on enhancing judicial openness and the report of the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate on strengthening oversight of investigative activities. We helped improve judicial credibility through our efforts to promote deepened reform of the judicial system, increase judicial openness, and standardize judicial behavior.\\n\\n\\tWe formulated the procedures for recording and reviewing normative documents to standardize and institutionalize this work. Over the past year, we reviewed every one of the 30-plus administrative regulations and judicial interpretations submitted by the State Council, the Supreme People\\'s Court, and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate, handling 92 suggestions on the review work from various departments. We conducted oversight to ensure correction of provisions discovered to be inconsistent with the law, so as to safeguard the unity of the country\\'s legal system.\\n\\n\\t5. We worked to see that deputies to the NPC fully played their principal role.\\n\\n\\tWe regarded giving full play to the role of deputies as an important measure for boosting the vitality of the NPC\\'s work, and have continued to deepen and expand our work related to deputies.\\n\\n\\t1) We worked to see better communication between the Standing Committee and deputies and between deputies and the people.\\n\\n\\tWe implemented the guidelines for ensuring members of the Chairperson\\'s Council and members of the Standing Committee maintain close contact with NPC deputies. This has helped us to strengthen our ties with deputies. We made it a regular practice for deputies to observe Standing Committee meetings, participate in law compliance inspections, and join the activities of special committees of the NPC and working committees of the Standing Committee. Over the past four years, we saw a cumulative deputy attendance of over 1,270 at Standing Committee meetings in a nonvoting capacity, as well as an attendance of over 1,200 in law compliance inspections and other activities. We urged the State Council, the Supreme People\\'s Court, and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate to strengthen their contact with deputies. In 2016, the State Council and its relevant departments invited over 1,700 deputy participants in their research activities and discussions, and the Supreme People\\'s Court and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate involved over 600 deputies in their research projects. We issued the guidelines on improving the system by which deputies to people\\'s congresses maintain contact with the people. For this purpose, we advanced the development of venues and online platforms enabling deputies to develop closer ties with the public, and improved the mechanism for relevant government departments to process and give feedback on the proposals and requests of the public passed on to them by deputies.\\n\\n\\t2) We improved our efficiency in examining deputies\\' proposals and ensuring handling of their suggestions.\\n\\n\\tRelevant special committees completed their examination of all 462 proposals referred to them by the Presidium of the Fourth Session of the 12th NPC. Of these, we have adopted 10 legislative items addressed in 32 of the submitted proposals; are deliberating 7 legislative items addressed in 26 of the proposals; and have included 42 legislative items discussed in 123 of the proposals in our annual legislative plan or five-year legislative program. All 8,609 suggestions, criticisms, and comments submitted by deputies have been handled, and 80.6% of the problems raised therein have been resolved or have been scheduled for gradual resolution.\\n\\n\\tThe State Council, the Supreme People\\'s Court, the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate, and relevant government departments attached great significance to the handling of deputies\\' suggestions, and the General Office of the Standing Committee and relevant special committees of the NPC worked conscientiously to coordinate and oversee this work. The State Council convened multiple executive meetings to hear reports on the handling of deputies\\' suggestions, and put forth the requirement that relevant departments make the handling of deputies\\' suggestions a standard and high-priority annual task, strengthen their communication with deputies, promptly respond to deputies\\' concerns, and accept deputies\\' oversight so as to ensure sound decision-making. In short, the comments and suggestions of deputies were seriously considered and adopted by relevant government departments as they developed policies and carried out their work.\\n\\n\\t3) We helped deputies improve their thinking, work style, and capabilities.\\n\\n\\tWe meticulously formulated and carried out study and training plans for deputies, helping them grasp and put into practice the guidelines of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 18th Party Central Committee and improve their thinking and work style. Last year we organized three study sessions and one seminar on special topics, which were attended by more than 1,000 deputies. We also organized research projects and inspection tours for deputies, which yielded a number of fruitful results and helped to move forward work in relevant fields.\\n\\n\\t6. We gave full expression to the NPC\\'s role in serving China\\'s overall interests through its international exchanges.\\n\\n\\tWe remained committed to the principle of complying with and working for China\\'s overall development interests and diplomatic work. We carried out overall planning for and greatly advanced the NPC\\'s foreign relations work.\\n\\n\\tWe strengthened and improved the mechanism of regular exchanges with foreign parliaments. The NPC has a mechanism for regular exchanges or carries out political dialogue with the parliaments of 20 countries including Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, India, Brazil, and South Africa, as well as with the European Parliament. Last year, we established mechanisms for cooperation with the parliaments of Kenya and Israel.\\n\\n\\tDelegations headed by members of the Chairperson\\'s Council visited 19 countries including Zambia, France, Finland, and Vietnam, helping maintain the positive momentum of high-level exchanges with these countries. As Chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC, I attended the Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), at which I delivered a speech presenting China\\'s stand on promoting peaceful development of the world and greater democracy in international relations. The attendance of the Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee at the IPU Assembly for the first time in history has helped to greatly increase the international influence of the NPC.\\n\\n\\tWe explored new forms of multilateral parliamentary diplomatic activities, working together with the IPU to hold, in China for the first time, a seminar for members of parliaments of Asian and African countries. We stepped up foreign exchanges and cooperation at various other levels, such as those conducted by NPC special committees, bilateral friendship groups, working bodies of the Standing Committee, and local people\\'s congresses. We continued to arrange for the NPC Tibetan Delegation to proactively conduct foreign exchanges. Over the past year, we received 55 parliamentary or other delegations.\\n\\n\\tBased on the NPC\\'s unique features and strengths, we put great effort into improving its foreign relations work in both scope and depth.\\n\\n\\tFirst, we strived to ensure that the consensus achieved between Chinese and foreign leaders is upheld, and worked to consolidate and enhance mutual political trust and foster mutual respect of each other\\'s core interests and major concerns, thus strengthening the political basis for the development of China\\'s relations with these countries.\\n\\n\\tSecond, we worked to promote mutually beneficial practical cooperation with other countries across various fields. We helped increase the complementarity between the development strategies of China and other countries concerned in the Belt and Road Initiative, and urged the parliaments of these countries to provide legal guarantees and favorable policy environments for bilateral pragmatic cooperation and personnel exchange.\\n\\n\\tThird, in working to serve China\\'s development strategy and the development of its democracy and rule of law, we strengthened international exchanges on the topic of state governance, learned from other countries\\' legislative experiences, and stepped up our work of explaining China\\'s major legislative items to the outside world.\\n\\n\\tFourth, by telling stories of China well and spreading Chinese visions, experience, and approaches, we have been able to see better understanding and wider recognition of China\\'s development path and foreign and domestic policies in the international community.\\n\\n\\tFifth, in responding to false statements and inappropriate actions by certain countries regarding the Taiwan question and issues concerning Tibet and the South China Sea, we resolutely safeguarded China\\'s sovereignty, security, and developmental interests by issuing statements, engaging talks, and taking other actions.\\n\\n\\tRatifying treaties and agreements concluded with foreign countries is a legally mandated duty of the NPCStanding Committee. The Paris Agreement has been the most important achievement of the multilateral efforts to address climate change in recent years. We deliberated and ratified this agreement, which demonstrates China\\'s willingness to shoulder its responsibilities as a large developing country and enables China to play an even bigger role in multilateral initiatives on climate change.\\n\\n\\t7. We intensified self-improvement efforts.\\n\\n\\tWe have continuously given top priority to improving our thinking and theoretical competence, held firm to ideals and convictions, stayed confident in the path, theory, system, and culture of Chinese socialism, and strengthened our sense of responsibility and mission. We threw ourselves into the Party-wide drive to help Party members better meet Party standards by studying the Party Constitution, Party regulations, and General Secretary Xi Jinping\\'s policy addresses, and consciously equipped ourselves with the latest achievements in adapting Marxism to Chinese conditions and used them to guide our practice and advance our work.\\n\\n\\tWe successfully organized Standing Committee seminars and strived to improve our capability for better performing our duties in accordance with the law. We strived to meet the requirements related to ensuring strict Party self-governance in every respect; made solid progress in improving Party conduct, promoting integrity, and fighting corruption; strictly implemented the Party Central Committee\\'s eight-point decision on improving Party and government conduct; and continued to improve our work style. We improved the system for reporting attendance of meetings, and worked hard to raise the quality of deliberation. Administrative bodies of the Standing Committee and special committees willingly accepted the special inspection and oversight by the central discipline inspection team and conscientiously worked to rectify problems identified in the inspection, thus improving themselves and their work in all respects.\\n\\n\\tWe strengthened leadership over the work of special committees and stressed the need for them to fulfill their crucial role. Special committees earnestly carried out their legally mandated duties and did a great deal of productive work, such as taking the lead in organizing the drafting of major legislative items, organizing inspections of compliance with laws, and carrying out in-depth research and studies. The Leading Party Members\\' Group of the Standing Committee set up branch groups in special committees to strengthen their work in relation to Party building. Fellow Deputies,\\n\\n\\tThe Standing Committee\\'s achievements this past year have been made under the sound leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core. They are the result of the careful, diligent, and hard work of all NPC deputies, members of the NPC Standing Committee and special committees, and the staff of the administrative bodies of the Standing Committee and special committees; the close coordination and cooperation of the State Council, the Supreme People\\'s Court, the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate, and local people\\'s congresses at all levels and their standing committees; and the full trust and great support of the entire Chinese people. On behalf of the Standing Committee, I would like to express our highest respect for and sincere gratitude to them all.\\n\\n\\tIn reviewing what we achieved over the past year, we are keenly aware that the work of the Standing Committee still has room for improvement. We still need to make legislation more targeted and effective under the new circumstances, where legislation initiatives are growing in number and the pace of and requirements for legislation are increasing. We need to increase the intensity and improve the methods of our oversight work to address the prominent problems of non-compliance with laws, lax law enforcement, and failure to prosecute violations of the law. We need to see better communication between the Standing Committee and deputies and between deputies and the public, and improve the thinking and work style of deputies and members of the Standing Committee. We must take these problems seriously and strive to improve our work in all respects by listening to comments and suggestions from deputies and all sectors of society with an open mind and willingly accepting their oversight.\\n\\n\\tMajor Tasks for This Year\\n\\n\\tIn 2017, the Communist Party of China will convene its 19th National Congress, the most important political event of the year for the Party and the country and an event of far-reaching significance. 2017 is also an important year for the implementation of China\\'s 13th Five-Year Plan and for the country\\'s advancement toward finishing building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. It is therefore extremely important that the NPC accomplishes all of its work for the year well.\\n\\n\\tThe overall requirements for the work of the NPC Standing Committee this year are as follows:\\n\\n\\t-- Uphold the firm leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core\\n\\n\\t-- Implement fully the guidelines from the 18th National Party Congress and those of the third through sixth plenary sessions of the 18th Party Central Committee\\n\\n\\t-- Take as our guide Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development\\n\\n\\t-- Fully grasp and put into practice the principles from General Secretary Xi Jinping\\'s major addresses and his new vision, thinking, and strategies for the governance of China\\n\\n\\t-- Remain committed to the underlying principle of making progress while keeping performance stable\\n\\n\\t-- Safeguard the authority of the Constitution and other laws\\n\\n\\t-- Strengthen legislation in key areas, with the focus on raising the quality of legislation\\n\\n\\t-- Deliver proper and effective oversight\\n\\n\\t-- Support and ensure deputies\\' law-based performance of their duties\\n\\n\\t-- Ensure successful accomplishment of all the work of the current NPC and its Standing Committee\\n\\n\\t-- Greet the convocation of the 19th National Party Congress with great achievements\\n\\n\\tThis year, we will ensure fulfillment of the following tasks.\\n\\n\\t1. Produce effective legislation to promote development and help ensure good governance\\n\\n\\tThe law is of great value to the governance of a country, and good laws are a prerequisite for good governance. With a view toward putting in place a socialist rule of law system with Chinese characteristics, the 12th NPCand its Standing Committee have conscientiously exercised state legislative powers, enacting, revising, repealing, and interpreting laws as necessary. By grasping and following the principles of legislative work, we have been able to continuously improve it.\\n\\n\\tIn reviewing the experience gained in recent years, we have realized that to do our legislative work well we must adhere to the following principles:\\n\\n\\tFirst, uphold the Party\\'s leadership over legislative work. We must work in line with the objectives and tasks set by the Party Central Committee for China\\'s legislative work. The Leading Party Members\\' Group of the Standing Committee must promptly request instructions from and submit reports to the Party Central Committee on major issues and matters in legislation.\\n\\n\\tSecond, allow legislation to play its guiding and driving role. We must remain committed to coordinating the advancement of both rule of law and reform and to ensuring rule of law and rule of virtue work in concert with one another. We must instill core socialist values into the development of the rule of law, and develop the rule of law to provide a guarantee for the country\\'s reform, development, and stability.\\n\\n\\tThird, ensure the NPC plays its dominant role in legislative work. We need to improve legislative systems and mechanisms, strengthen organization and coordination in relation to legislative work, and make this work more timely, systematic, targeted, and effective.\\n\\n\\tFourth, legislate more effectively and democratically. In line with the idea of putting the people first in legislation and making legislation for them, we must build up broad consensus on legislation and ensure that legislative bodies properly fulfill their important role of voicing, balancing, and adjusting the interests of different sectors of society.\\n\\n\\tThis coming year, we will better adhere to the above mentioned ways of thinking, principles, and methods, given their proven effectiveness in our legislative work. We will strengthen both legislation in key areas and work regarding the enactment, revision, abolition, and interpretation of laws related to reform. We will raise the quality of legislation and ensure that the objectives and tasks set for legislative work are met and accomplished.\\n\\n\\tFirst, we will carry out the decision and plan of the Party Central Committee on deepening reform of the national supervision system. This means that we will revise the Law on Administrative Supervision to turn it into a national supervision law, so as to provide a legal guarantee for our efforts to put in place a centralized, unified, authoritative, and highly-efficient national supervision system.\\n\\n\\tSecond, we will improve the legal system with a view toward building new systems for development. After issuing the General Provisions of Civil Law, we will step up our work on compiling the individual books of a civil code. We will strengthen protection of civil law rights and improve our system of laws and regulations concerning equal protection of property rights. To ensure law-based taxation, we will formulate laws on specific taxes, such as a tobacco leaf tax law and a tonnage tax law. To improve the modern market system, we will work on establishing an e-commerce law and revising several laws, including the Anti-Unfair Competition Law, the Law on Promoting Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, the Law on Farmers\\' Specialized Cooperatives, the Securities Law, and the Standardization Law.\\n\\n\\tThird, we will strengthen the development of laws and regulations concerning social, cultural, ecological, and other issues. We will formulate a community correction law, a basic medical and health care law, and a law on public libraries, so as to improve the social governance system, push forward the building of a Healthy China, and guarantee the people\\'s cultural rights and interests. To promote ecological progress, we will enact a law for the prevention and control of soil pollution and revise the Law on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution. We will formulate a nuclear safety law, an intelligence law, and a law on international judicial assistance in criminal matters, and revise the Surveying and Mapping Law. We will also revise the Organic Law of the People\\'s Courts and the Organic Law of the People\\'s Procuratorates.\\n\\n\\tFourth, we will effectively carry out work concerning the authorization of pilot reforms.\\n\\n\\t2. Deliver proper and effective oversight\\n\\n\\tOversight by the NPC and its Standing Committee over the work of the State Council, the Supreme People\\'s Court, and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate, and over the enforcement of the Constitution and other laws, is both an inherent requirement and institutional design of the system of people\\'s congresses and a practice that embodies the constitutional principle that all state power belongs to the people. The 12th NPC Standing Committee has effectively exercised the power of oversight granted to it by the Constitution and other laws and has adhered to the basic principle that oversight must be proper and effective. Throughout this process, we have developed a deeper understanding of the designed functions of oversight by people\\'s congresses as well as the principles governing this work.\\n\\n\\tTo exercise proper oversight, it is vital that we consistently uphold leadership by the Party and coordinate our oversight work nationwide. We must exercise oversight in strict accordance with our legally mandated powers and statutory procedures. We must have both the courage and the competence to carry out oversight and properly manage the relationship between oversight and support, so that we can truly help the State Council carry out administration in accordance with the law and help the Supreme People\\'s Court and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate administer justice impartially. This is a way for us to work together with them and help them strengthen and improve their work.\\n\\n\\tTo deliver effective oversight, it is crucial that we keep to a problem-oriented approach and identify the focal points of our oversight work, while keeping in mind the overall work of the Party and the country. We should improve the way we carry out oversight, conducting follow-up oversight to get to the bottom of problems and see real results. This will allow us to work toward resolution of major and difficult issues of common concern to NPC deputies and the general public, and to ensure that the people gain a greater sense of benefit.\\n\\n\\tThis coming year, we will keep in mind and put into practice the new development philosophy and adhere to the vision of people-centered development. We will strengthen oversight over the implementation of laws and over the work of the State Council, the Supreme People\\'s Court, and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate, so that we can help ensure steady and sound economic development as well as social harmony and stability.\\n\\n\\tFirst, we will intensify oversight of the implementation of laws. We will inspect compliance with the Pharmaceutical Administration Law, the Product Quality Law, the Copyright Law, the Law on the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution Caused by Solid Wastes, the Seed Law, and the Cybersecurity Law.\\n\\n\\tSecond, we will strengthen oversight of government budgets and final accounts. We will hear and deliberate the State Council\\'s reports on the central government\\'s final accounts for 2016, on auditing work, on budget implementation, and on the rectification of problems discovered in auditing. We will conduct research on topics such as standardizing non-tax revenue management, and explore ways to put in place a system through which the State Council reports to the NPC Standing Committee on the management of state-owned assets. We will press ahead with the integrated online oversight of budgets.\\n\\n\\tThird, with a focus on the government\\'s comprehensive initiatives to ensure steady growth, advance reform, make structural adjustments, improve living standards, and guard against risks, we will hear and deliberate reports of the State Council on the implementation of the plan for national economic and social development and on the work to advance supply-side structural reform and accelerate transformation and upgrading of manufacturing. We will hear and deliberate reports of the State Council on poverty reduction progress, on allocation and utilization of government funds for education, on drug administration, and on protection of cultural heritage. We will hear and deliberate the State Council\\'s reports on the state of the environment and the fulfillment of environmental protection targets in 2016, and on its work concerning grassland ecological conservation and environmental protection. We will conduct research on the implementation of the Law on the Protection of Minors, on economic and social development in townships where ethnic minorities live, and on protection of the rights and interests of overseas Chinese.\\n\\n\\tFourth, with a view to promoting judicial impartiality, we will hear and deliberate reports of the Supreme People\\'s Court and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate on their work to comprehensively deepen judicial reform.\\n\\n\\tFifth, we will make consistent efforts to strengthen oversight over enforcement of the Constitution. We will hold events to mark National Constitution Day and organize in accordance with the law swearing-in ceremonies for pledging allegiance to the Constitution. We will accelerate the building of a nationally unified information platform for recording and reviewing normative documents so as to improve our work in this regard.\\n\\n\\t3. Ensure well-organized elections of deputies to people\\'s congresses\\n\\n\\tThe election of deputies is the foundation of the system of people\\'s congresses and is of great importance for consolidating the Party\\'s position as the governing party, ensuring the position of the people as masters of the country, and strengthening state power. In line with the Party Central Committee\\'s arrangements and requirements concerning the election of new deputies to people\\'s congresses, we will formulate the necessary legal documents and organize the election of deputies to the 13th NPC, acting in accordance with the Constitution and other laws including the Electoral Law for the National People\\'s Congress and Local People\\'s Congresses. We will provide guidance to electoral bodies to help them organize elections well, study the lessons learned from the voting bribery case in Liaoning Province, and, through a combination of strict preventative measures and disciplinary regulations, ensure that the right direction is maintained in elections and the elections are conducted honestly. We will ensure that elections of deputies to the 13th NPC are properly organized in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions. Review of deputies\\' qualifications will be strengthened in accordance with the law. We will see that the national joint conference on the election of new deputies to people\\'s congresses at the county and township levels fully plays its role, and ensure elections at these two levels are well organized.\\n\\n\\t4. Strengthen and improve the NPC\\'s deputy-related work\\n\\n\\tDuring these past four years, the deputies to the 12th NPC, bearing in mind the great trust the people have placed in them, have performed their duties in accordance with the law and participated in the exercise of state power so as to represent the interests and will of the people. Their efforts have laid a solid foundation for the work of the NPC and its Standing Committee, and they have made great contributions to the development of the cause of the Party and the country. To ensure that the people serve as the masters of the country, we will continue to respect the principal position of deputies, consciously accept oversight from deputies and the public, and see to it that people\\'s congresses and their standing committees always represent the people.\\n\\n\\tThis coming year, we will continue to listen to deputies\\' comments and suggestions using a variety of channels, urge the State Council, the Supreme People\\'s Court, and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate to strengthen their communication with deputies, and broaden channels through which deputies can learn about state affairs and the government\\'s work. We will invite deputies to observe meetings of the Standing Committee, and arrange for them to participate in the Standing Committee\\'s law compliance inspections and attend relevant meetings and study and training activities of special committees. We will implement the guidelines on improving the system by which deputies to people\\'s congresses keep in contact with the people, so as to ensure deputies better communicate with the people and respond to each and every one of the people\\'s concerns. We will help deputies improve their political stand, thinking, and work style and ensure they are better able to carry out their duties, and we will strengthen oversight of deputies to see that they carry out their duties and functions in accordance with the law.\\n\\n\\t5. Ensure success in all other aspects of the NPC\\'s work\\n\\n\\tWe will actively carry out foreign relations work.\\n\\n\\tIn accordance with the Party Central Committee\\'s major policies and overall plan for China\\'s diplomatic work, we will consolidate and deepen mechanism-based exchanges with relevant foreign parliaments, especially those of neighboring countries and countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. We will actively take part in multilateral parliamentary diplomatic activities and make use of both top-level exchanges and friendly exchanges at other levels to enhance political trust and pragmatic cooperation with other countries and deepen friendship with other peoples, thus helping create a favorable external environment for China\\'s development.\\n\\n\\tWe will improve the NPC\\'s information and public communication work and theoretical research.\\n\\n\\tTo maintain the initiative in work concerning the public discourse, we will work to understand, explain, and communicate the new theoretical and practical accomplishments that the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinpingat its core has made in upholding and improving the system of people\\'s congresses and in fully advancing the law-based governance of China, and we will demonstrate clearly the achievements and progress China has made in developing socialist democracy and the rule of law. To maintain the right tone in public communication, we will improve the NPC\\'s press release work and enhance its public communication capacity. We will hold events to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the implementation of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\\n\\n\\tWe will continue to promote the development and improvement of the work of local people\\'s congresses.\\n\\n\\tWe will take steps to strengthen the work and development of people\\'s congresses at the county and township levels, organize study sessions for leading members of the standing committees of county-level people\\'s congresses, and offer better guidance on legislative work to local people\\'s congresses.\\n\\n\\tIn accordance with the Party Central Committee\\'s requirement that the system by which people\\'s congresses discuss and decide major issues be improved and that people\\'s governments at all levels report to people\\'s congresses at the same level before publishing major policy decisions, we will make sure that people\\'s congresses properly perform their tasks in discussing and deciding major issues and better carry out their functions as organs of state power.\\n\\n\\tWe will strengthen self-improvement of the Standing Committee in all respects.\\n\\n\\tWe will improve our thinking and theoretical competence; take a clear stand in emphasizing politics; raise our awareness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, uphold the leadership core, and keep in alignment; and safeguard the authority of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core and uphold its centralized, unified leadership. We will deepen our understanding of the guiding principles of the Party\\'s strict self-governance so as to ensure better implementation of them, strictly observe political discipline and rules, and create an honest and upright political environment. We will comprehensively improve the administrative bodies of the Standing Committee and special committees. Utilizing the lessons learned from addressing the problems discovered by the central discipline inspection team during its special inspection of these bodies, we will help these bodies better assist and support deputies and ensure their officials are loyal to the Party, honest, and responsible.\\n\\n\\tFellow Deputies,\\n\\n\\tToday, we are closer than ever in history to realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and we have greater confidence in achieving this goal and greater capability to do so than ever before. Rallying even closer around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, let us stay true to the Party\\'s founding mission and continue to move forward as we work with creativity and tap into our potential to uphold, implement, and develop the system of people\\'s congresses, achieve the Two Centenary Goals,(1) and realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.\\n\\n\\tNote(1) This refers to completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects by the time the Communist Party of China celebrates its centenary in 2021 and turning the People\\'s Republic of China into a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and harmonious by the time it celebrates its centenary in 2049.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2017/0318/c90000-9192149.html'}\n"

Wielding \"the baton of human rights,\" it pointed fingers and cast blame on the human rights situation in many countries while paying no attention to its own terrible human rights problems. People cannot help asking about the actual human rights situation of the United States in 2016. Concrete facts show that the United States saw continued deterioration in some key aspects of its existent human rights issues last year. With the gunshots lingering in people\\'s ears behind the Statue of Liberty, worsening racial discrimination and the election farce dominated by money politics, the self-proclaimed human rights defender has exposed its human rights \"myth\" with its own deeds.\\n\\n\\t-- The frequent occurrence of gun-related crimes led to heavy casualties and the incarceration rate remained high. There were a total of 58,125 gun violence incidents, including 385 mass shootings, in the United States in 2016, leaving 15,039 killed and 30,589 injured (www.gunviolencearchive.org, December 31, 2016). The United States had the second highest prisoner rate, with 693 prisoners per 100,000 of the national population (www.statista.com, April 2016). There had been 70 million Americans incarcerated - that\\'s almost one in three adults - with some form of criminal record (harvardlawreview.org, January 5, 2017).\\n\\n\\t-- Livelihood of middle- and low-income groups was worrisome amid widening income gap. In 2016, the proportion of adult Americans who had a full-time job hit a record low since 1983. Over the last three decades, nearly 70 percent of income ended up in the pockets of the wealthiest 10 percent. The population of U.S. middle-class registered a turning point toward contraction. Besides, one out of seven Americans remained in poverty, with life of 45 million people in strained circumstances. The average life expectancy fell from 78.9 years to 78.8 years as the United States posted a drop in overall life expectancy for the first time in over 20 years.\\n\\n\\t-- Racism continued to exist and racial relations worsened. In 2016, the United Nations\\' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent reported to the United Nations Human Rights Council that racial problems were severe in the United States. The colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remained a serious challenge. Police killings were reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching. The United States was undergoing a \"human rights crisis\" (www.un.org, August 18, 2016).\\n\\n\\t-- There was no improvement to the protection of rights of women, children and elders, and the vulnerable groups\\' rights were seriously violated. Women were paid much less compared to their male colleagues. Women with city government jobs in New York made 18 percent less than men (www.nydailynews.com, April 11, 2016). Women comprised about 60 percent of California workers earning minimum wage or less (www.sandiegouniontribune.com, April 10, 2016). Sexual harassments and assaults took place frequently. Roughly one in four women said they have been harassed on the job (www.usatoday.com, July 7, 2016). A total of 20 percent of young women who attended college during a four-year span said they had been sexually assaulted (www.washingtonpost.com, March 5, 2016). Poverty rate among children remained high and an estimated 6.8 million people aged 10 to 17 are food insecure (www.urban.org, September 11, 2016). Cases of elder abuse happened from time to time and about 5 million older adults were subject to abuse each year (www.csmonitor.com, June 15, 2016).\\n\\n\\t-- The United States repeatedly trampled on human rights in other countries and willfully slaughtered innocent victims. From August 8, 2014 to December 19, 2016, the United States launched 7,258 air strikes in Iraqand 5,828 in Syria, causing 733 incidents with an estimated number of civilian deaths between 4,568 and 6,127 (airwars.org, December 19, 2016). Since 2009, the upper limit of the civilian death toll from U.S. drones stood at more than 800 people in Pakistan, Yemenand Somalia. (www.theguardian.com, July 1, 2016) The issue of illegal detention and torturing prisoners of other countries remained unsolved.\\n\\n\\t-- The United States refused to approve core international conventions on human rights and did not accept UN draft resolutions related to human rights. It still has not ratified core international human rights conventions, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women; the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. At the 71st General Assembly of the UN, the United States voted against draft resolutions related to human rights including \"The right to development,\" \"Human rights and unilateral coercive measures,\" \"Promotion of a democratic and equitable international order,\" and \"Declaration on the right to peace\" (www.un.org, December 19, 2016).\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x904ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x905ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x906ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x907ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2017/0309/c90000-9188125.html'}\n"

The two sides are now communicating on future exchanges between their presidents.\\n\\n\\t\"There is no reason why China and the United States cannot become excellent partners,\" Wang said.\\n\\n\\tSu Ge, president of the China Institute of International Studies, said China\\'s preference for cooperation over confrontation is a break from Cold War mentality, which has led to conflicts between traditional and rising world powers in the past.\\n\\n\\t\"The approach is an innovation, reflecting the philosophy that countries around the world are tied together and need to march forward through thick and thin,\" he told Xinhua in an interview.\\n\\n\\tOver the past year, tensions also calmed down visibly in the South China Sea, with ties between China and the Philippines notably improving.\\n\\n\\tWang said since Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte came into office, the Southeast Asian country has extended a hand of goodwill.\\n\\n\\t\"China, of course, will embrace it with open arms of cooperation,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tOn Africa, Wang said there will be no weakening in China\\'s support no matter how the international situation or world economy may evolve. In 2015, China announced 60 billion U.S. dollars funding support for the continent. The support is being implemented through phases.\\n\\n\\tINITIATIVE\\n\\n\\tChina in 2013 proposed the Belt and Road Initiative, aiming to build a modern trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along ancient Silk Road routes.\\n\\n\\tIt has since won support from over 100 countries and international organizations, with nearly 50 cooperation agreements signed between governments.\\n\\n\\tThe initiative made progress at a time when the world\\'s traditional multilateral mechanisms are feared to have lost steam.\\n\\n\\tWang said it has become the most popular public goods initiative and its implementation has opened a new chapter of openness and win-win cooperation.\\n\\n\\tChina will host the Beijing Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in May, with attendance of more than 20 heads of state and government, over 50 leaders of international organizations, and more than 100 ministerial-level officials among the 1,000-plus delegates, he said.\\n\\n\\tThis year, China also serves as the rotating chair of BRICS and will host the bloc\\'s ninth leaders\\' summit in September.\\n\\n\\tWang noted with optimism that the mechanism will not lose its luster.\\n\\n\\tIt will shine more brightly if its members stay united, he added.\\n\\n\\tAccording to estimates, the share of BRICS gross domestic product in the world economy stood at 21.3 percent in 2013. On purchasing power parity terms, the bloc\\'s economy reached 30 trillion U.S. dollars that year, tailing only slightly behind that of the G7.\\n\\n\\t\"The BRICS countries are like five fingers: short and long if extended, but a powerful fist if clenched together,\" Wang said, citing remarks by Xi.\\n\\n\\tCONSISTENCY\\n\\n\\tBRICS is not the only multilateral mechanism China supports. Wang reaffirmed that China champions multilateralism, openness and inclusiveness amid a growing backlash against globalization and rising protectionism.\\n\\n\\t\"In the face of skepticism over the existing international order and system, we have always called for maintaining it, and where necessary, improving it,\" Wang said. \"The consistency and continuity of China\\'s diplomacy are its due responsibilities as a large country.\"\\n\\n\\tThe foreign minister also highlighted consistency in Chinese diplomacy, saying that China has adhered to the path of peaceful development in the face of instability and conflicts.\\n\\n\\tOn the Korean Peninsular, where the Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea (DPRK) traded missile launches with large-scale military drills held by the United States and Republic of Korea (ROK).\\n\\n\\tWang compared the two sides to \"two accelerating trains, coming toward each other.\"\\n\\n\\t\"Are the two sides really ready for a head-on collision?\" Wang asked. \"The priority is to flash the red light and apply the brakes.\"\\n\\n\\tChina proposed \"double suspension\" to defuse the looming crisis -- the DPRK suspending its nuclear and missile activities while the United States and ROK ceasing war games.\\n\\n\\tChina is willing to be a \"railway switchman\" to switch the issue back to the right track, he added.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2017/0309/c90000-9187749.html'}\n",

Its economic and trade volumes take up nearly 60 percent and half of the world\\'s total, respectively. It has an important strategic position in the world. In recent years, the development of the Asia-Pacific region has increasingly caught people\\'s attention. It has become the most dynamic region with the strongest potential in the world. All parties are attaching greater importance to and investing more in this region. With the profound adjustment of the pattern of international relations, the regional situation of the Asia-Pacific area is also undergoing profound changes.\\n\\n\\tChina is committed to promoting peace and stability in this region. It follows the path of peaceful development and the mutually beneficial strategy of opening up, and pursues friendly cooperation with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It has participated in regional cooperation in an all-round way and taken active steps in response to both traditional and non-traditional security challenges, contributing to lasting peace and common prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.\\n\\n\\tI. China\\'s Policies and Positions on Asia-Pacific Security Cooperation\\n\\n\\tCurrently, the situation in the Asia-Pacific region is stable on the whole, with a strong momentum for peace and development. The Asia-Pacific region is a stable part of the global landscape. To promote peace and seek stability and development is the strategic goal and common aspiration of most countries in the region. Political mutual trust among countries has been strengthened, and major countries have frequently interacted and cooperated with one another. To address differences and disputes through negotiation and consultation is the major policy of countries in the region. Regional hotspot issues and disputes are basically under control.The region has secured steady and relatively fast growth, continuing to lead the world in this respect. Regional integration has gathered pace, with booming sub-regional cooperation. Free trade arrangements in various forms have made steady progress, and a new phase has emerged for dynamic connectivity building. However, the Asia-Pacific region still faces multiple destabilizing and uncertain factors. The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is complex and sensitive; the reconciliation process in Afghanistanremains slow; and disputes over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests continue to unfold. Some countries are increasing their military deployment in the region, certain country seeks to shake off military constraints, and some countries are undergoing complex political and social transformations. Non-traditional security threats such as terrorism, natural disasters and transnational crimes have become more prominent. Asia\\'s economy still faces significant downward pressure as a result of its structural problems as well as external economic and financial risks.\\n\\n\\tAs an important member of the Asia-Pacific family, China is fully aware that its peaceful development is closely linked with the future of the region. China has all along taken the advancement of regional prosperity and stability as its own responsibility. China is ready to pursue security through dialogue and cooperation in the spirit of working together for mutually beneficial results, and safeguard peace and stability jointly with other countries in the region.\\n\\n\\tFirst, we should promote common development and lay a solid economic foundation for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. To enhance the convergence of economic interests is an important basis for sound state-to-state relations. Common development provides a fundamental safeguard for peace and stability, and holds the key to various security issues. Considerable achievements have been made in economic cooperation. On this basis, we should accelerate the process of economic integration and continue to advance the building of free trade areas and connectivity as well as comprehensive economic and social development. We should implement the United Nations2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and narrow the developmental gap in the region, so that all countries and people of all social strata will enjoy the dividends of development, and the interests of countries will be more closely intertwined.\\n\\n\\tFocusing on common development, China has put forward and actively promoted the Belt and Road Initiative and initiated the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund. We welcome continued participation by all countries for mutually beneficial outcomes.\\n\\n\\tSecond, we should promote the building of partnerships and strengthen the political foundation for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Asia-Pacific countries have unique diversities. Countries may become partners when they have the same values and ideals, but they can also be partners if they seek common ground while reserving differences. The key is to remain committed to treating each other as equals and carrying out mutually beneficial cooperation. How major countries in the Asia-Pacific region get along with each other is critical for maintaining regional peace and development. Major countries should treat the strategic intentions of others in an objective and rational manner, reject the Cold War mentality, respect others\\' legitimate interests and concerns, strengthen positive interactions and respond to challenges with concerted efforts. Small and medium-sized countries need not and should not take sides among big countries. All countries should make joint efforts to pursue a new path of dialogue instead of confrontation and pursue partnerships rather than alliances, and build an Asia-Pacific partnership featuring mutual trust, inclusiveness and mutually beneficial cooperation.\\n\\n\\tChina calls for the building of a new model of international relations centered on mutually beneficial cooperation. China is committed to building partnerships in different forms with all countries and regional organizations. China has committed itself to working with the United Statesto build a new model of major-country relations featuring non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect, and mutually beneficial cooperation. China is committed to deepening its comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination with Russiaand establishing a closer partnership with India. It is also pushing for the improvement of its relations with Japan. Chinese leaders have repeatedly elaborated on the concept of a community of shared future on many different occasions. China is working to construct a community of shared future for countries along the Lancang-Mekong River and between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well as in Asia and the Asia-Pacific area as a whole.\\n\\n\\tThird, we should improve the existing regional multilateral mechanisms and strengthen the framework for supporting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. All parties concerned should adhere to multilateralism, oppose unilateralism, further support the development of regional multilateral security mechanisms, push for close coordination between relevant mechanisms, and play a bigger role in enhancing mutual understanding and trust, and expanding exchanges and cooperation in the field of security dialogues.\\n\\n\\tCommitted to pushing forward the building of regional security mechanisms, China initiated with relevant countries the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Six-Party Talks, Xiangshan Forum, China-ASEAN Ministerial Dialogue on Law Enforcement and Security Cooperation, and Center for Comprehensive Law Enforcement and Security Cooperation in the Lancang-Mekong Sub-Region. China has actively supported the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in its capacity and institution building, and participated in the ASEAN-led multilateral security dialogues and cooperation mechanisms. Within various regional mechanisms, China has made a large number of cooperation proposals in the field of non-traditional security, which have strongly promoted relevant exchanges and cooperation. China will shoulder greater responsibilities for regional and global security, and provide more public security services to the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.\\n\\n\\tFourth, we should promote the rule-setting and improve the institutional safeguards for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. To live together in peace, countries should follow the spirit of the rule of law, the international norms based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and the widely recognized rules of fairness and justice. International and regional rules should be discussed, formulated and observed by all countries concerned, rather than being dictated by any particular country. Rules of individual countries should not automatically become \"international rules,\" still less should individual countries be allowed to violate the lawful rights and interests of others under the pretext of \"rule of law.\"\\n\\n\\tChina has firmly upheld and actively contributed to international law, and regional rules and norms. To practice the rule of law in international relations, China, together with India and Myanmar, initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in 1954. China has acceded to almost all inter-governmental international organizations and more than 400 international multilateral treaties so far. China is committed to upholding regional maritime security and order, and enhancing the building of institutions and rules. In 2014 China presided over the adoption of the updated Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea at the Western Pacific Naval Symposium held in China. China and ASEAN countries will continue to fully and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea(DOC) and strive for the early conclusion of a Code of Conduct (COC) on the basis of consensus in the framework of the DOC. In addition, China has taken an active part in consultations on setting rules in new areas such as cyberspace and outer space, so as to contribute to the formulation of widely accepted fair and equitable international rules.\\n\\n\\tFifth, we should intensify military exchanges and cooperation to offer more guarantees for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. China faces diverse and complex security threats and challenges, as well as the arduous task of safeguarding national unity and territorial integrity. Building strong national defence and armed forces that are commensurate with China\\'s international standing and its security and development interests is a strategic task in China\\'s modernization drive, and provides a strong guarantee for its peaceful development. China\\'s armed forces provide security and strategic support for the country\\'s development and also make positive contributions to the maintenance of world peace and regional stability.\\n\\n\\tChina\\'s armed forces have called for, facilitated, and participated in international security cooperation. China has followed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, conducted all-round military exchanges with other countries, and developed non-aligned and non-confrontational military cooperation not targetting any third party. It has worked to promote the establishment of just and effective collective security mechanisms and military confidence-building mechanisms. On the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and mutually beneficial cooperation, China has increased interactions and cooperation with the armed forces of other countries, and intensified cooperation on confidence-building measures in border areas. China has promoted dialogue and cooperation on maritime security, participated in United Nations peacekeeping missions, international counter-terrorism cooperation, escort missions and disaster-relief operations, and conducted relevant joint exercises and training with other countries.\\n\\n\\tSixth, we should properly resolve differences and disputes, and maintain a sound environment of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Most of the hotspot and sensitive issues in this region have been left over from history. To handle them, the countries in the region should follow the tradition of mutual respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and peaceful coexistence, and work to solve disputes properly and peacefully through direct negotiation and consultation. We should not allow old problems to hamper regional development and cooperation, and undermine mutual trust. For disputes over territories and maritime rights and interests, the sovereign states directly involved should respect historical facts and seek a peaceful solution through negotiation and consultation in accordance with the fundamental principles and legal procedures defined by universally recognized international law and modern maritime law, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Pending a satisfactory solution to disputes, the parties concerned should engage in dialogue to promote cooperation, manage each situation appropriately and prevent conflicts from escalating, so as to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the region.\\n\\n\\tChina is committed to upholding peace and stability in the South China Sea, and working for peaceful solutions to the disputes over territories and maritime rights and interests with the countries directly involved through friendly negotiation and consultation. This commitment remains unchanged. China has actively pushed for peaceful solutions to hotspot issues such as the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and the Afghanistanissue, and played its due role as a responsible major country.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x904ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x905ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x906ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2017/0111/c90000-9165659.html'}\n"

He wrote on Twitter, â\\x80\\x9cChina has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but wonâ\\x80\\x99t help with North Korea. Nice!â\\x80\\x9d Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s words are alarming, but his claim is groundless.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tThe Boeing Company sees China as a $1 trillion market. Chinese President Xi Jinping toured the companyâ\\x80\\x99s commercial airplane factory in Everett, Washington, in September 2016. At the welcome ceremony, President Xi noted Boeingâ\\x80\\x99s cooperation with China and praised the win-win results. The results are backed by solid data. According to a report by Bloomberg, the company has delivered 967 aircraft to China since 2000, worth about $60.2 billion at 2016 prices. The vice chairman of the company said deliveries to China by Boeing support approximately 150,000 American jobs every year.\\n\\n\\tChinese companies create jobs and fight unemployment in America. Golden Dragon, a Chinese company based in Xinxiang, China, invested nearly $100 million to build a large copper-tube plant in Thomasville City, Alabama, employing about 150 people in one of the poorest regions in America. At the grand opening in May 2014, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley called Golden Dragon a â\\x80\\x9csignificant opportunity for the people of Wilcox County.â\\x80\\x9d It was the first manufacturing project in the county in over half a century. If Trump wants to rebuild America, he will be happy to know that Chinese investors are making trade and investment between the two countries a two-way street.\\n\\n\\tAccording to a report by the Rhodium Group, the U.S. became the largest recipient of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s outbound foreign direct investment in 2016, with $45.6 billion worth of acquisitions and investments, and direct investment by Chinese in the U.S. economy since 2000 exceeds $100 billion. China is the top market for Apple and GM, and Telsa and other companies are building their brands in China. Companies both big and small understand the importance of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s huge market, including The Trump Organization. Trump Hotels plans to open 20-30 luxury hotels in China, according to a report by The Washington Post.\\n\\n\\tHowever, misunderstandings about the China-U.S. relationship persist, even within the President-electâ\\x80\\x99s small inner circle. Michael Flynn, who will advise Trump on important national security issues, believes China is allied with â\\x80\\x9cradical Islamists.â\\x80\\x9d In his book, The Field of Fight, Flynn makes the argument that China is a member of an â\\x80\\x9cenemy allianceâ\\x80\\x9d in a global war against the West. His claim is not based on solid facts, and this type of thinking is dangerous if he advices the next President in this way.\\n\\n\\tFortunately, most Americans do not share the incoming administrationâ\\x80\\x99s fondness for fake news and conspiracy theories about China. In June 2016, Flynn tweeted that he was â\\x80\\x9cnow followingâ\\x80\\x9d China, and asked users to â\\x80\\x9cplease send me anything you get on China activities.â\\x80\\x9d The humorous responses show the deep interconnectedness between China and the U.S. Below are some of them:\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t@stanleyfosha tweeted: â\\x80\\x9cSir, report from the field. Discovered a coded [message] on the label indicating China manufactured this keyboard.â\\x80\\x9d @liguy743 tweeted: â\\x80\\x9cThey have a huge population. People in orbit. Lander on Moon. Nukes. Bigly army. Lots of US T-bills,â\\x80\\x9d then added, â\\x80\\x9cChk CIA factbook for details.â\\x80\\x9d @marvelle tweeted: â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve got 4 suspicious Chinese nationals under surveillance in DC,â\\x80\\x9d and included a link to the Smithsonianâ\\x80\\x99s National Zooâ\\x80\\x99s Panda Cams. @BruceNV tweeted: â\\x80\\x9cThey just started non-stop flights to Vegas. Might be the start of the invasion,â\\x80\\x9d then added, â\\x80\\x9c[Canâ\\x80\\x99t] tell if they are staying [at The Trump Organization].â\\x80\\x9d @dtom_dangerzone tweeted: â\\x80\\x9cThere is an unusual amount of activity near the Shenzhen area. Lots of technology being made... investigating.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\tTrump and his inner circle at the White House need to develop a realistic understanding of the China-U.S. relationship. The amusing comments under Flynnâ\\x80\\x99s tweet show that China and the U.S. are in a deep, interconnected relationship; not just economically, but also on cultural and people-to-people exchange fronts.

Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s latest move is another troubling sign that America will take a more assertive foreign policy approach in the face of increasing U.S. decline and impotence relative to China and other emerging powers reshaping the international system.\\n\\n\\tThe Trump Transition Team describes Navarro as a visionary economist who will develop trade policies that shrink the U.S. trade deficit, expand U.S. growth, and help stop the exodus of jobs from U.S. shores. But Navarro is also a strident China critic.\\n\\n\\tNavarro views China as the greatest long-term threat to the West. His view dovetails with others in Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s inner circle, such as Trump advisor Michael Pillsbury. Pillsbury authored the book, â\\x80\\x9cThe Hundred-Year Marathon,â\\x80\\x9d an alarmist work that argues Beijing is secretly plotting to take over the world. Fu Ying, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairperson of the National Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s Congress, has described Pillsburyâ\\x80\\x99s book as â\\x80\\x9cnonsense,â\\x80\\x9d according to an article by Foreign Policy.\\n\\n\\tIn his book The Coming China Wars, Navarro argues that the U.S. needs to â\\x80\\x9caggressively and comprehensively address the China problem.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\tIn a 2012 film based on his book Death by China, Navarro described the China-U.S. trade relationship as one of the most urgent problems facing America. He blamed China for the loss of 57,000 American factories and 25 million American jobs. Against a fear-provoking backdrop image that shows a large â\\x80\\x9cMade in Chinaâ\\x80\\x9d knife being driven into an American flag, he says, â\\x80\\x9cHelp defend America, and protect your family. Donâ\\x80\\x99t buy made in China.â\\x80\\x9d The film has been criticized for hyping up the â\\x80\\x9cChina threat.â\\x80\\x9d Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times, for example, described the film as â\\x80\\x9cunabashedly one-sided.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\tIn 2015, Navarro wrote an article for The National Interest on Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s rise. He blamed Americaâ\\x80\\x99s singular focus on the war on terrorism for distracting the West from the real issue: â\\x80\\x9cA revisionist Beijing [that] will quietly continue its expansionism in the East.â\\x80\\x9d He views Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s rise as a threat to American power, and believes that America should be free to roam the Asia-Pacific region. â\\x80\\x9cThe Asia-Pacific isâ\\x80¦home to 50% of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s population and likely more than 70% of future economic growth â\\x80\\x93 and therefore a part of the world where Americaâ\\x80\\x99s economic and strategic future ultimately lays,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote. Future leaders should â\\x80\\x9cnever lose sight of this essential truth.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\tChina has been watching Trump closely. His position on China has been all over the place and remains uncertain, but the trend is disturbing. Trump continues to surround himself with China critics who view China as a threat, and their arguments are often devoid of facts. While the China-U.S. relationship is complex, there are many benefits. It is a mutually beneficial relationship. The opposite of that of course means that it could be mutually destructive too.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2016/1222/c90000-9158212.html'}\n"

      "825,{'發稿日': ['September23', '2016'], '新聞標題': \"Full Text: Premier Li Keqiang's remarks at roundtable with prominent figures from U.S. economic, financial, academic, media circles\", '作者': 'Xinhua', '新聞內文': 'NEW YORK, Sept. 22\\xa0 -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiangmet here Tuesday with over a dozen of prominent figures from U.S. economic, financial, academic and media circles at Waldorf Astoria and answered questions regarding China-U.S. relations and other issues of common interest.\\n\\n\\tAmong those present were: former Mayor of New York City and founder of Bloomberg LP Michael Bloomberg, former Secretary of State Dr. Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Henry Paulson, IBM Chair and CEO Ginni Rometty, Chairman and CEO of the Blackstone Group Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO of Dow Chemical Company Andrew Liveris, President and CEO of MetLife Steven Kandarian, President of the Council on Foreign Relations Richard Haass, and PBS anchor Charlie Rose.\\n\\n\\tThe following is a transcript of Premier Li\\' s remarks at the roundtable:\\n\\n\\tIn his opening remarks, Premier Li said: I would like to thank Mr. Bloomberg for moderating today\\' s event. We may not have too many participants today, but I appreciate the presence of so many towering figures and important representatives from the business community, financial sector, think tanks and media.\\n\\n\\tI particularly appreciate this opportunity to meet my old friends Dr. Kissinger, Secretary Paulson and other old friends. Maybe there are a few that I\\' m meeting for the first time. I remember receiving a copy of On China from Dr. Kissinger and a copy of On the Brink from Secretary Paulson. China and the U.S. not only have stable political ties, but also enjoy very close business cooperation. I was told that in every second each day, a Chinese is buying an iPhone. Maybe those Chinese customers buying the iPhone are not aware that the real Big Apple is the New York City.\\n\\n\\tThis time I\\' ve come to the New York City to attend the General Debate of the UN General Assembly and a series of high-level UN events. And I cherish this opportunity for discussions with prominent figures from relevant circles in New York to exchange views with you on China-U.S. relations and issues of mutual interest.\\n\\n\\tResponding to a question on the Belt and Road Initiative, Premier Li said: China and the U.S. are respectively the world\\' s biggest developing and developed countries. A growing and stable China-U.S. relationship is in the interest of the people of both countries. It is also conducive to global peace, development and stability.\\n\\n\\tThere were Silk Roads both on land and at sea for interactions between ancient China and countries in other parts of the world. In order to enhance connectivity with other countries, particularly countries in our neighborhood, and facilitate the flow of goods and people, the Chinese government put forward the initiative of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (the Belt and Road Initiative).\\n\\n\\t\"Silk\" is the very key word in this new initiative. This means that the initiative is about exchanging commerce. It is about interactions between countries in a peaceful and stable environment. And it is about the flow of goods instead of fight between soldiers.\\n\\n\\tThis Belt and Road Initiative is mainly oriented at China having closer interactions with neighboring countries and those on the Eurasian continent. And an important principle guiding this initiative is for China to align this initiative with the development strategies of countries participating in this initiative, instead of for this initiative to replace the development strategies of others. The advantage of doing so is that it will make it much easier for the countries involved to link up their transportation infrastructure such as railways, roads and ports to facilitate commerce, and naturally that will bring greater benefits to people of both sides.\\n\\n\\tThe initiative is first and foremost about China aligning its development strategies between neighboring countries. If countries further away are interested in taking a part, we are open to cooperation, but certainly on a voluntary basis from both sides.\\n\\n\\tWhen asked about China-U.S. relations and market environment in China, Premier Li said: Given the differences in our cultural background and national conditions, I believe it is only natural for China and the U.S. to have frictions or run into problems in growing this relationship. But what\\' s more important is for us to bear in mind the mainstream and the general trend in China-U.S. ties.\\n\\n\\tIn the past several decades since diplomatic relations were established, we have seen much rain and winds in growing this relationship. But after each rain, the sky only gets even clearer. And I believe it is hard for anyone to imagine how much this relationship has grown in the past several decades. Before we established diplomatic ties, we had a mere sum of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars of two-way trade. But the figure last year surged to 560 billion dollars, not to mention the people-to-people flow, which doubled in the past five years. This doesn\\' t mean that I hope there will be more rains so we can have clearer skies. Hopefully there will be less rain or just a drizzle, and more clear sunny days.\\n\\n\\tTalking about mutual investment, I also heard complaints from some business people. Before we normalized our relations, there was virtually zero mutual investment. And there was also zero complaint too. But now, U.S. investment in China has grown to over 70 billion dollars. So how is it possible for it to be completely problem-free. But I will make it clear here that China will only open even wider to the outside world. Now we are having this BIT negotiation with the U.S. on a basis of pre-establishment national treatment and a negative list approach. This sends a very positive message to the business communities in both China and the U.S. for mutual investment to go steady and in a positive direction.\\n\\n\\tOver the past three years, the Chinese government has made tremendous efforts to streamline its administration and delegate powers to ease the restrictions on doing business. For example, in terms of the number of items and areas where foreign investment is restricted, that number is halved, and we intend to cut it further.\\n\\n\\tSometimes I would receive letters from some U.S. business people expressing concerns or complaints. Honestly, I take the issues expressed in these letters seriously. I don\\' t want to see individual issues affecting China-U.S. business ties. But at the same time, I also receive reports from Chinese governmental departments. They told me that in the first half of 2016, U.S. investment in China has grown by 1.2 times. I have also seen reports from the U.S. CBC saying that over 90 percent of U.S. companies making investment in China are making profits.\\n\\n\\tI think these two tally with each other. For such a large economy as China, as it undertakes massive reform, it will take a step-by-step process. There may be some twists and turns in the cooperation process in certain localities or sectors. But the overall trend is that China will only open wider to the world; a door that has been opened cannot be closed again.\\n\\n\\tOn China\\' s big data and cloud computing industries and access of foreign capital, Premier Li said: Big data and cloud computing are fast-growing industries in China. On the whole, they have played a positive role in China\\' s economic transformation. But at the same time, some problems also surfaced. Recently, there has been a case of someone using big data to commit fraud that has led to family tragedies, theft of trade secrets and unlawful disclosure of personal information. So we are exploring ways to improve relevant regulations.\\n\\n\\tChina\\' s big data and cloud computing industries should be open and safe, capable of protecting commercial secrets and personal information and allowing systems to operate in a safe and secure environment. So we will do it bit by bit, and we are ready to discuss with foreign companies how we can find an effective way to develop these industries that we can keep them open and secure.\\n\\n\\tOn the very day that I arrived in New York, I read about the chief of a very important U.S. agency warning that when you are not using Skype or other video communication programs, you need to seal off the camera on your computers physically. Otherwise, you will have your privacy exposed. I already told my ministers that this is very important. Measures to protect information security need to be improved.\\n\\n\\tWhen asked about China-U.S. trade and the BIT negotiations, Premier Li said: Globalization started with trade liberalization across borders. Britain was the first one to benefit from globalization, and the U.S. has been the biggest beneficiary from globalization. And in recent years, China has been one of the major beneficiaries from globalization too.\\n\\n\\tIn globalization, benefits can be shared, the comparative advantages of countries can be leveraged, and people\\' s lives can be improved. But for anything, it is impossible for it to have just an upside without any downside. So in the course of globalization, some people may feel their interests hurt, and some sectors have lost their vested interests. Hence, there is this backlash against globalization.\\n\\n\\tBut I see recent developments as a hiccup in the course of globalization. On the whole, I believe as we live on the same planet, each individual has his own strength, just as each country has its own comparative advantage. So we need to complement each other. Globalization, trade liberalization and investment facilitation are the trend going forward. We need to address the downsides of globalization, but one should not give up eating for fear of choking, as a Chinese saying goes.\\n\\n\\tI believe China\\' s active efforts in the negotiations of the BIT shows China\\' s commitment to trade liberalization and investment facilitation. In just two years, China has for three times revised its offer in the BIT negotiations. We hope the U.S. will be equally actively engaged in the negotiations.\\n\\n\\tFor example, we hope the U.S. will further ease its restrictions on high-tech exports to China. Such exports may not take up a large share in China-U.S. trade, but its impact is a significant one. I believe that through negotiation, our two sides will be able to reach a high standard and mutually beneficial BIT.\\n\\n\\tOn U.S. presidential election and access to China\\' s insurance market, Premier Li said: I have come here to New York for UN events, but some friends told me that I am not coming at a right time, because it is the campaign season, which is the internal affair of the U.S.. So there is little I can say about this except that no matter who becomes the next president, it is important that China-U.S. relations continue to develop in a sound and steady manner. But one thing is definitely clear, that is, China is a firm defender of free trade, and we always push forward free trade under the WTOframework. This position will not change, because China, together with many other countries, has been a beneficiary of free trade. How can China give up what it has gained from? It doesn\\' t make sense.\\n\\n\\tTalking about China\\' s insurance market, it has developed for a very short time. Therefore we do lack experience, and we are taking steps to enhance and improve our regulatory structure to protect the policy holders. Every year, the elderly population in China grows by a large margin, so there is a huge insurance market in China.\\n\\n\\tIn developing its insurance market, China needs to draw upon the advanced experience of foreign countries and get foreign companies involved in this process, so that this market will be one of bigger vitality and consumers will have more options and choices. I want to tell you that in the most recent revised offer that China put to the BIT negotiations, further commitments on insurance sector opening-up were made, and I believe there is great potential for China-U.S. cooperation in this respect.\\n\\n\\tWhen asked about the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Premier Li said: China is a firm defender of the international nuclear nonproliferation regime, and is firmly opposed to nuclear tests by the DPRK. China is committed to the denuclearization, peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula as well as a solution through dialogue and consultation.\\n\\n\\tWe don\\' t want to see turmoil, let alone war, on the Peninsula, nor do we want to see large-scale movements of refugees or an arms race in the region. So we hope all relevant countries will work together to get the North back to the negotiating table to find a fundamental solution through negotiations to the nuclear and missile test issue.\\n\\n\\tNot long ago, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2270 and China voted in favor of it. Now China is implementing this resolution fully and earnestly in its entirety. I had a discussion about this issue with the U.S. leader in our meeting yesterday.\\n\\n\\tWe both believe that China and the U.S. should have further communications on the situation and agree with further response from the Security Council to the latest nuclear test. China hopes that the issue can be fundamentally resolved politically through diplomatic means, as we have seen on the Iranian nuclear issue.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2016/0923/c90000-9118938.html'}\n"

      "837,{'發稿日': ['September23', '2016'], '新聞標題': \"Full Text: Premier Li Keqiang's remarks at roundtable with prominent figures from U.S. economic, financial, academic, media circles\", '作者': 'Xinhua', '新聞內文': 'NEW YORK, Sept. 22\\xa0 -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiangmet here Tuesday with over a dozen of prominent figures from U.S. economic, financial, academic and media circles at Waldorf Astoria and answered questions regarding China-U.S. relations and other issues of common interest.\\n\\n\\tAmong those present were: former Mayor of New York City and founder of Bloomberg LP Michael Bloomberg, former Secretary of State Dr. Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Henry Paulson, IBM Chair and CEO Ginni Rometty, Chairman and CEO of the Blackstone Group Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO of Dow Chemical Company Andrew Liveris, President and CEO of MetLife Steven Kandarian, President of the Council on Foreign Relations Richard Haass, and PBS anchor Charlie Rose.\\n\\n\\tThe following is a transcript of Premier Li\\' s remarks at the roundtable:\\n\\n\\tIn his opening remarks, Premier Li said: I would like to thank Mr. Bloomberg for moderating today\\' s event. We may not have too many participants today, but I appreciate the presence of so many towering figures and important representatives from the business community, financial sector, think tanks and media.\\n\\n\\tI particularly appreciate this opportunity to meet my old friends Dr. Kissinger, Secretary Paulson and other old friends. Maybe there are a few that I\\' m meeting for the first time. I remember receiving a copy of On China from Dr. Kissinger and a copy of On the Brink from Secretary Paulson. China and the U.S. not only have stable political ties, but also enjoy very close business cooperation. I was told that in every second each day, a Chinese is buying an iPhone. Maybe those Chinese customers buying the iPhone are not aware that the real Big Apple is the New York City.\\n\\n\\tThis time I\\' ve come to the New York City to attend the General Debate of the UN General Assembly and a series of high-level UN events. And I cherish this opportunity for discussions with prominent figures from relevant circles in New York to exchange views with you on China-U.S. relations and issues of mutual interest.\\n\\n\\tResponding to a question on the Belt and Road Initiative, Premier Li said: China and the U.S. are respectively the world\\' s biggest developing and developed countries. A growing and stable China-U.S. relationship is in the interest of the people of both countries. It is also conducive to global peace, development and stability.\\n\\n\\tThere were Silk Roads both on land and at sea for interactions between ancient China and countries in other parts of the world. In order to enhance connectivity with other countries, particularly countries in our neighborhood, and facilitate the flow of goods and people, the Chinese government put forward the initiative of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (the Belt and Road Initiative).\\n\\n\\t\"Silk\" is the very key word in this new initiative. This means that the initiative is about exchanging commerce. It is about interactions between countries in a peaceful and stable environment. And it is about the flow of goods instead of fight between soldiers.\\n\\n\\tThis Belt and Road Initiative is mainly oriented at China having closer interactions with neighboring countries and those on the Eurasian continent. And an important principle guiding this initiative is for China to align this initiative with the development strategies of countries participating in this initiative, instead of for this initiative to replace the development strategies of others. The advantage of doing so is that it will make it much easier for the countries involved to link up their transportation infrastructure such as railways, roads and ports to facilitate commerce, and naturally that will bring greater benefits to people of both sides.\\n\\n\\tThe initiative is first and foremost about China aligning its development strategies between neighboring countries. If countries further away are interested in taking a part, we are open to cooperation, but certainly on a voluntary basis from both sides.\\n\\n\\tWhen asked about China-U.S. relations and market environment in China, Premier Li said: Given the differences in our cultural background and national conditions, I believe it is only natural for China and the U.S. to have frictions or run into problems in growing this relationship. But what\\' s more important is for us to bear in mind the mainstream and the general trend in China-U.S. ties.\\n\\n\\tIn the past several decades since diplomatic relations were established, we have seen much rain and winds in growing this relationship. But after each rain, the sky only gets even clearer. And I believe it is hard for anyone to imagine how much this relationship has grown in the past several decades. Before we established diplomatic ties, we had a mere sum of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars of two-way trade. But the figure last year surged to 560 billion dollars, not to mention the people-to-people flow, which doubled in the past five years. This doesn\\' t mean that I hope there will be more rains so we can have clearer skies. Hopefully there will be less rain or just a drizzle, and more clear sunny days.\\n\\n\\tTalking about mutual investment, I also heard complaints from some business people. Before we normalized our relations, there was virtually zero mutual investment. And there was also zero complaint too. But now, U.S. investment in China has grown to over 70 billion dollars. So how is it possible for it to be completely problem-free. But I will make it clear here that China will only open even wider to the outside world. Now we are having this BIT negotiation with the U.S. on a basis of pre-establishment national treatment and a negative list approach. This sends a very positive message to the business communities in both China and the U.S. for mutual investment to go steady and in a positive direction.\\n\\n\\tOver the past three years, the Chinese government has made tremendous efforts to streamline its administration and delegate powers to ease the restrictions on doing business. For example, in terms of the number of items and areas where foreign investment is restricted, that number is halved, and we intend to cut it further.\\n\\n\\tSometimes I would receive letters from some U.S. business people expressing concerns or complaints. Honestly, I take the issues expressed in these letters seriously. I don\\' t want to see individual issues affecting China-U.S. business ties. But at the same time, I also receive reports from Chinese governmental departments. They told me that in the first half of 2016, U.S. investment in China has grown by 1.2 times. I have also seen reports from the U.S. CBC saying that over 90 percent of U.S. companies making investment in China are making profits.\\n\\n\\tI think these two tally with each other. For such a large economy as China, as it undertakes massive reform, it will take a step-by-step process. There may be some twists and turns in the cooperation process in certain localities or sectors. But the overall trend is that China will only open wider to the world; a door that has been opened cannot be closed again.\\n\\n\\tOn China\\' s big data and cloud computing industries and access of foreign capital, Premier Li said: Big data and cloud computing are fast-growing industries in China. On the whole, they have played a positive role in China\\' s economic transformation. But at the same time, some problems also surfaced. Recently, there has been a case of someone using big data to commit fraud that has led to family tragedies, theft of trade secrets and unlawful disclosure of personal information. So we are exploring ways to improve relevant regulations.\\n\\n\\tChina\\' s big data and cloud computing industries should be open and safe, capable of protecting commercial secrets and personal information and allowing systems to operate in a safe and secure environment. So we will do it bit by bit, and we are ready to discuss with foreign companies how we can find an effective way to develop these industries that we can keep them open and secure.\\n\\n\\tOn the very day that I arrived in New York, I read about the chief of a very important U.S. agency warning that when you are not using Skype or other video communication programs, you need to seal off the camera on your computers physically. Otherwise, you will have your privacy exposed. I already told my ministers that this is very important. Measures to protect information security need to be improved.\\n\\n\\tWhen asked about China-U.S. trade and the BIT negotiations, Premier Li said: Globalization started with trade liberalization across borders. Britain was the first one to benefit from globalization, and the U.S. has been the biggest beneficiary from globalization. And in recent years, China has been one of the major beneficiaries from globalization too.\\n\\n\\tIn globalization, benefits can be shared, the comparative advantages of countries can be leveraged, and people\\' s lives can be improved. But for anything, it is impossible for it to have just an upside without any downside. So in the course of globalization, some people may feel their interests hurt, and some sectors have lost their vested interests. Hence, there is this backlash against globalization.\\n\\n\\tBut I see recent developments as a hiccup in the course of globalization. On the whole, I believe as we live on the same planet, each individual has his own strength, just as each country has its own comparative advantage. So we need to complement each other. Globalization, trade liberalization and investment facilitation are the trend going forward. We need to address the downsides of globalization, but one should not give up eating for fear of choking, as a Chinese saying goes.\\n\\n\\tI believe China\\' s active efforts in the negotiations of the BIT shows China\\' s commitment to trade liberalization and investment facilitation. In just two years, China has for three times revised its offer in the BIT negotiations. We hope the U.S. will be equally actively engaged in the negotiations.\\n\\n\\tFor example, we hope the U.S. will further ease its restrictions on high-tech exports to China. Such exports may not take up a large share in China-U.S. trade, but its impact is a significant one. I believe that through negotiation, our two sides will be able to reach a high standard and mutually beneficial BIT.\\n\\n\\tOn U.S. presidential election and access to China\\' s insurance market, Premier Li said: I have come here to New York for UN events, but some friends told me that I am not coming at a right time, because it is the campaign season, which is the internal affair of the U.S.. So there is little I can say about this except that no matter who becomes the next president, it is important that China-U.S. relations continue to develop in a sound and steady manner. But one thing is definitely clear, that is, China is a firm defender of free trade, and we always push forward free trade under the WTOframework. This position will not change, because China, together with many other countries, has been a beneficiary of free trade. How can China give up what it has gained from? It doesn\\' t make sense.\\n\\n\\tTalking about China\\' s insurance market, it has developed for a very short time. Therefore we do lack experience, and we are taking steps to enhance and improve our regulatory structure to protect the policy holders. Every year, the elderly population in China grows by a large margin, so there is a huge insurance market in China.\\n\\n\\tIn developing its insurance market, China needs to draw upon the advanced experience of foreign countries and get foreign companies involved in this process, so that this market will be one of bigger vitality and consumers will have more options and choices. I want to tell you that in the most recent revised offer that China put to the BIT negotiations, further commitments on insurance sector opening-up were made, and I believe there is great potential for China-U.S. cooperation in this respect.\\n\\n\\tWhen asked about the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Premier Li said: China is a firm defender of the international nuclear nonproliferation regime, and is firmly opposed to nuclear tests by the DPRK. China is committed to the denuclearization, peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula as well as a solution through dialogue and consultation.\\n\\n\\tWe don\\' t want to see turmoil, let alone war, on the Peninsula, nor do we want to see large-scale movements of refugees or an arms race in the region. So we hope all relevant countries will work together to get the North back to the negotiating table to find a fundamental solution through negotiations to the nuclear and missile test issue.\\n\\n\\tNot long ago, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2270 and China voted in favor of it. Now China is implementing this resolution fully and earnestly in its entirety. I had a discussion about this issue with the U.S. leader in our meeting yesterday.\\n\\n\\tWe both believe that China and the U.S. should have further communications on the situation and agree with further response from the Security Council to the latest nuclear test. China hopes that the issue can be fundamentally resolved politically through diplomatic means, as we have seen on the Iranian nuclear issue.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2016/0923/c90000-9118938.html'}\n"

He then proclaimed that \"I am your voice\" to the American people.\\n\\n\\tTrump also launched a series of attacks on his Democratic Party rival Hillary Clinton, accusing her of keeping \"our rigged system in place\" and leaving \"death, destruction and weakness\" as her legacy.\\n\\n\\tAccording to a leaked draft speech transcript published by the website Politico.com, Trump seldom went off script and when he did, he often repeated what he had just said and added an exclamation point.\\n\\n\\tTrump\\'s speech was consistent with the theme of many of his previous speeches, where he painted the current state of the country as bleak, dangerous and constantly under attack, and saying only he could solve the various problems if elected president.\\n\\n\\tBut he again failed to provide any detailed policies to explain how he would manage to realize all his promises.\\n\\n\\tThere were also notable different talking points from speeches made by previously nominated Republican candidates, including protecting the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community and little mention of his faith and religious beliefs.\\n\\n\\tThe speech also deviated from his routine rhetoric in several points. He did not resort to calling his opponent degrading nicknames, he did not reiterate his proposal of a total ban on Muslims into the country, and he did not echo the crowd\\'s chants of \"lock her up\" when talking about Clinton, but said \"We\\'ll defeat her\" instead.\\n\\n\\tThe longer-than-usual speech marked the end of a year-long dramatic nomination campaign journey and the start of the uphill battle for the 270 electoral votes he needs in November.\\n\\n\\tEleven months ago, Trump descended on an escalator inside his Fifth Avenue Trump Tower in New York to announce his candidacy for the GOP presidential nomination. Nobody had thought he could go this far.\\n\\n\\tIn the months after that, he managed to constantly make inflammatory remarks against women, Muslims, Mexicans, foreign countries, belittle his opponents by calling them \"Lying Ted,\" \"Little Marco\" and \"Crooked Hillary,\" and still plowed through all the controversies that ensued.\\n\\n\\tOn Tuesday, Trump was officially declared the party\\'s presidential nominee after a state-by-state vote.\\n\\n\\tBut the win had come at the cost of a seriously divided Republican Party, where many prominent figures of the party, including two previous Republican presidents and two previous Republican presidential nominees refused to attend his crowning party.\\n\\n\\tIn the four-day event, anti-Trump factions in the party tried to push through a roll call vote to change convention rules, which would allow some of the delegates who had voted for Trump to recast their votes to other candidates.\\n\\n\\tOn Wednesday, Texas Senator and former rival Ted Cruz publicly refused to endorse Trump and told voters instead to \"vote your conscience,\" a move local newspapers deemed a \"civil war.\"\\n\\n\\tThe division has been alarming to the establishment members of the party.\\n\\n\\tRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus spoke at the event, applauded traditional Republican values and called for party unity by saying \"let\\'s stand united as Republicans, let\\'s get to work to expand our Republican majorities.\"', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2016/0722/c90777-9089942.html'}\n"

He also answered questions about the US \"Freedom of Navigation Program\" in the South China Sea, how China would respond to the arbitration \"award\", and how the South China Sea issue would affect the China-US relations.\\n\\n\\tThe edited record of the conversation is as follows:\\n\\n\\tLiu Zhenmin: First of all, on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I welcome you, friends from the US media, and I wish to thank the China-United States Exchange Foundation for arranging this meeting. This afternoon we will talk about the South China Sea issue.\\n\\n\\tIn the Foreign Ministry, I\\'m responsible for Asian, boundary and ocean affairs, and treaty and law. Much of my time has been spent on the South China Sea issue this year, a frequent topic at meetings between me and friends from ASEAN and other countries outside the South China Sea region, like the United States.\\n\\n\\tMany media reports about the South China Sea issue do not actually reflect the mainstream views of the international community. Some foreign media, especially Western media, blame China for the current situation in the South China Sea. This is a misunderstanding that shows insufficient knowledge of the Western media about the realities in the South China Sea and Southeast Asia.\\n\\n\\tOver the past few months, through my discussions with friends from ASEAN countries and outside this region, and my own reflection on the matter, I observed that Southeast Asian countries never really enjoyed peace from the Age of Discovery to colonial times, to WWII and then to the end of the Cold War. This time span can be further divided into two phases. The entire Southeast Asia, except Thailand, was colonized by Western powers before WWII and then occupied by Japan during WWII, and countries in this region obtained independence only by the end of WWII. In the following 20-plus years, they were heavily affected by the Cold War. The US fought a long war in Vietnam, Cambodia suffered foreign invasion and domestic conflict, the US built military bases in the Philippines, and the former Soviet Union also kept strong military presence in the unified Vietnam.\\n\\n\\tEnormous changes took place in Southeast Asia after the end of the Cold War. The US and the former Soviet Union withdrew troops, and the conflict in Cambodia came to an end. Since then, Southeast Asia has enjoyed 26 years of peace, making possible stability and prosperity and enabling the China-ASEAN relations to grow. China resumed diplomatic relationship with Indonesia and established that with Singapore in 1990, and with Brunei in 1991, thus having diplomatic relations with all Southeast Asian countries. China and ASEAN also developed a dialogue partnership, of which we are to celebrate the 25th anniversary this year. Over this past 25 years, China has become the largest trading partner of ASEAN and many of its members, and ASEAN is now China\\'s third largest trading partner, next only to the EU and the US. Two-way trade has exceeded US$400 billion. In the meantime, China became Asia\\'s biggest and the world\\'s second biggest economy in 2010.\\n\\n\\tThese development achievements may have invited jealousy. The US launched its \"Asia-Pacific rebalancing\" in 2010, and the six years afterwards have seen profound impacts in Southeast Asia. As far as the South China Sea issue is concerned, the \"Asia-Pacific rebalancing\" emboldened certain ASEAN countries, a typical example being the Philippines\\' provocation of the Huangyan Dao Incident in 2012 and its unilateral initiation of the South China Sea arbitration in January 2013.\\n\\n\\tThere is much attention these days in the western media coverage about China\\'s construction on the islands and reefs. But China only started such construction at the end of 2013, the timing of which indicates that China was forced to react, given the changes in regional situation. Some media reports have been blaming China\\'s construction on the islands and reefs for the rising tension in the South China Sea. We do not agree because China was actually the last one to carry out such construction, after the Philippines and other claimants. And a major difference here is that the other claimants\\' construction has been on Chinese islands and reefs that they illegally occupied, whereas China\\'s construction is on its own islands and reefs. It is wrong of the US and Western media to name China the source of rising tension in the South China Sea.\\n\\n\\tAs the largest coastal country of the South China Sea and the world\\'s biggest trading nation in goods, China has a high stake in the South China Sea which is a crucial trading route. The peace, stability and freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea is critical to China. As a matter of fact, China cares about the peace and stability in the South China Sea more than all other countries, the US included. No one should doubt this. Even for its own sake, China is firmly committed to upholding regional peace and will take action against possible threats if necessary.\\n\\n\\tThis is my opening remarks, and I\\'m ready to answer your questions.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t1. Newsweek: China has dispatched military vessels and aircraft in response to the \"Freedom of Navigation Program\" implemented by the US in the South China Sea. How does China view the potential conflicts that may ensue?\\n\\n\\tLiu Zhenmin: We respect the freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea of all countries including the United States under international law. But the recent actions by our American friends seem to have gone beyond the scope of \"freedom of navigation and overflight\" entitled by international law.\\n\\n\\tAccording to international law including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), countries enjoy two types of freedom of navigation and overflight: first, in territorial sea and airspace, a country must meet the standard of \"innocent passage\" or obtain the approval of the coastal states and pay due regard to their sovereignty, security and dignity; second, in areas beyond territorial sea, a country enjoys the freedom of navigation and overflight but it also needs to pay due respect to the sovereignty, security and dignity of other countries concerned.\\n\\n\\tIt has been 37 years since the US launched its \"Freedom of Navigation Program\". The US knows China\\'s positions and policies concerned. The US should be aware that its freedom of navigation and overflight is only in certain areas of the South China Sea, and it should be careful not to intrude into the territorial sea and airspace of China and surrounding countries.\\n\\n\\tAs I said, China needs a peaceful and stable South China Sea and has no intention for frictions with US military vessels and aircraft. But the US should refrain from making provocations. We certainly don\\'t want another air collision like the one on 1 April, 2001. The world is changing and the China-US relations are deepening, the US should be more friendly toward China. You may still remember the meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Obama at the Annenberg Estate in 2013. The theme of that meeting was to build a new model of major-country relationship between China and the United States. A consideration behind this concept proposed by President Xi is to avoid the \"Thucydides trap\". China won\\'t become another Soviet Union. There are three elements in this new model of major-country relationship between China and the US - non-conflict and non-confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation. The Amercian friends quite recognize the first and third elements, but are somehow reluctant on the second. We respect the US, and naturally we hope the US respect China as well.\\n\\n\\tDevelopment is the common aspiration of the 1.3 billion Chinese people. Three years into the buidling of major-country relationship, bilateral ties between China and the US are getting closer, trade and investment growing steadily, and cooperation yielding win-win results.. The interests of the two countries are closely interconnected, and the two countries have win-win cooperation on global issues such as climate change and the Iranian nuclear issue. The Asia-Pacific is actually the only area where China and the United States have different views, but even here the difference is not large. China respects the US presence in the Asia-Pacific and hopes the US will also respect China\\'s increasing role in this region. In sum, China is confident in the future of China-US relations.\\n\\n\\t2. Newsweek: Does China have a red line on the South China Sea issue? If yes, what is it?\\n\\n\\tLiu Zhenmin: My answer is both yes and no. We have made it known to the US about our red lines on a number of issues. For instance, we have asked the US not to support \"Taiwan independence\" and to support the cross-Strait reunification. On the South China Sea issue, we have asked the US not to take sides or support its so-called ally against China. A major problem now in Southeast Asia or the entire East Asia is America\\'s military alliance. If there is a red line, it is that we don\\'t want the United States to infringe upon China\\'s sovereignty and security. On these two matters, there is no room for China to compromise or make any concession. We, the Chinese, fought for decades to change China from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country into an independent country with national sovereignty and security. President Xi Jinping said to President Obama that the Pacific Ocean is vast enough for two big countries as China and the US. Our two countries can have sound cooperation in the Asia-Pacific, the Pacific and beyond. There is no need for the US to make provocations near the shore of China.\\n\\n\\t3. The Guardian: What\\'s China\\'s attitude toward the award of the South China Sea arbitration unilaterally initiated by the Philippines? What do you think of the jurisdiction of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)?\\n\\n\\tLiu Zhenmin: The first thing people should know is that the arbitral tribunal established at the request of the Philippines is not an international court or a permanent court of arbitration, but a temporary arbitral tribunal comprising five arbitrators designated by Mr. Shunji Yanai, former president of the ITLOS. The Philippines claimed that the arbitration it initiated on January 22, 2013 was not to settle any specific disputes, but to ask the arbitral tribunal to judge on questions about the interpretation and application of the Convention. China does not accept or participate in the arbitration, and the arbitral tribunal has lent a ready ear only to the Philippines. I think the award will probably be in the Philippines\\' favor.\\n\\n\\tChina doesn\\'t see the arbitration as a move of good will. It is intended to legalize the Philippines\\' illegal claims and negate China\\'s rights in the South China Sea. The Chinese government released the Position Paper of the Government of the People\\'s Republic of China on the Matter of Jurisdiction in the South China Sea Arbitration Initiated by the Republic of the Philippines on 7 December 2014, which gives a full explanation about China\\'s position. Our position is clear: the arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction over the subject matter. In fact, in a number of bilateral agreements, China and the Philippines agreed to settle the South China Sea disputes through negotiation and consultation, and both countries have signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (\"DOC\") along with other ASEAN countries in 2002. The Article 4 of the DOC stipulates that disputes in the South China Sea should be settled by directly concerned states peacefully through negotiation and consultation. As to maritime delimitation, the Chinese government issued in 2006 a declaration under Article 298 of UNCLOS to exclude maritime delimitation from UNCLOS compulsory dispute settlement procedures.\\n\\n\\tChina recognizes the dispute settlement procedures provided by UNCLOS, but the Philippines\\' initiation of arbitration and the arbitral tribunal\\'s establishment of jurisdiction are obviously against the Convention. The South China Sea arbitration unilaterally initiated by the Philippines is nothing but a political scheme for one party to insult the other and will be recorded as an infamous case in the history of international law. The Philippines has acknowledged the existence of disputes with China. But the arbitration it initiated is, as the Philippines claimed, not intended to settle the disputes. Then why should China participate in it and comply with the so-called \"award\"? We can expect propaganda by countries like the Philippines and the US about the award having binding power for China. China will make clear its position of not recognizing or accepting the award and will justify why the award has no binding power.\\n\\n\\tChina will stay committed to settling the South China Sea disputes with the Philippines through negotiation and consultation, and we hope the next Philippine administration will adopt new thinking on the issue. Arbitration is not the way out and will give no benefits to the Philippines, but only doing harm to China-Philippines relations. Meanwhile, we don\\'t see any gains for the US from the arbitration case. We don\\'t understand why the US has been so active in backing the arbitration behind the scene. As time goes by, I believe the plot will eventually come to light. In sum, the arbitration initiated by the Philippines is dishonest and not based on good will. China will not accept or participate in it, let alone to recognize the so-called \"award\".\\n\\n\\t4. NBC: If the difference between China and the US over the South China Sea issue cannot be resolved, will that affect their interactions in other fields?\\n\\n\\tLiu Zhenmin: As a matter of fact, China and the US don\\'t have major clash of interests in the South China Sea, and neither wants frictions. The US has made an issue of the \"freedom of navigation and overflight\" recently to echo with the arbitration unilaterally initiated by the Philippines, and it has been helping the Philippines build up military capacity. Nonetheless, we believe the US government is well aware of its interests in the South China Sea. It hopes to use the South China Sea issue as an excuse to restore military presence in the Asia-Pacific. The US has actually achieved this goal already, and has no need to enter into military conflict with any country in the Southeast Asia. What matters now is that the US government should recognize that time is changing, and there are far more benefits for China and US and China and Southeast Asian countries to cooperate rather than going to war. China doesn\\'t want a war, and we will oppose the US if it initiates any conflict in East Asia. And certainly, if events such as the Vietnam War or the war on the Korean Peninsula happen again, China will have to defend itself.\\n\\n\\tBut we think such things will not happen. Some reports on the situation in Southeast Asia by media from countries in this region, the US and the West are not balanced. The joint military exercises and patrols by the US and relevant countries cannot besiege China, not possible 30 years ago and much less today. No one can stand in the way of China\\'s development. I would like to share with you some basic facts. In its fastest growth, the Chinese economy contributed as much as 50% to the world economic growth, and 30% even today. The US economy also contributes a big share in the growth of the world economy. Thus no one wants to see frictions between China and the US, because slowing down of the Chinese and US economies is bound to affect the global economy. I don\\'t know whether in the United States there are people who want war in East Asia. But no country in this region, from Northeast to Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, wants to have a war. We hope the US government and military can join East Asian countries in cherishing peace and stability in the region.\\n\\n\\tFrankly speaking, there are different voices within the US about the Asia-Pacific, and its domestic politics is less predictable recent days. This worries us and we hope consensus could be reached inside the US to work with China on the new type of major-country relationship that features \"non-conflict and non-confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation\". This will lead to sound interactions in the Asia-Pacific and serve the interests of China, the US and the region at large.\\n\\n\\t5. Chicago Tribune: When the Arbitral Tribunal makes the final award, will China accept and recognize it? What does China think of the future trend of the South China Sea situation?\\n\\n\\tLiu Zhenmin: China will not implement the award, nor will the \"award\" change anything. There is no agency entitled to act as the international \"police\" and \"award\" depends on countries for recognition and implementation. This is the essence of international law, which needs the respect from sovereign nations.\\n\\n\\tFrom procedure to substance, the arbitration initiated by the Philippines doesn\\'t comply with international law including the UNCLOS. Even after the tribunal makes its award, the South China Sea issue will still exist and the US will not be able to settle it. It has neither the capability nor the authority to do so. At the end of the day, the South China Sea issue has to be settled by China and ASEAN countries through negotiation and consultation.\\n\\n\\tThe US is being nosy to intervene in the arbitration. China and ASEAN have their own channel to solve the South China Sea issue, i.e. the DOC signed by China and ASEAN countries in 2002, and a consultation mechanism set up for its implementation. In addition, after many years of negotiation, China and Vietnam finalized the maritime delimitation in Beibu Gulf in 2001, followed by another 10 years of negotiation that led to an agreement signed in 2011 on the basic principles of solving maritime issues. The negotiation between China and Vietnam is still ongoing, covering maritime delimitation and cooperation in areas of low sensitivity. China has similar communication mechanisms with Malaysia and Brunei.\\n\\n\\tIn fact, before the Philippines\\' unilateral initiation of the arbitration, China and the Philippines had many dialogue mechanisms and confidence-building measures. At the time of the previous Philippine administration, China, the Philippines and Vietnam even signed an agreement on maritime seismic research cooperation in some areas of the South China Sea. Such cooperation discontinued due to the change of administration in the Philippines. This shows that China and the Philippines have the basis for settling the South China Sea disputes through negotiation and consultation, and this basis is in keeping with international law including the UNCLOS. Arbitration is not the basis for seeking settlement. The attitude of the new Philippine administration is important for whether China and the Philippines can cooperate on the South China Sea. If a right position is adopted, I believe cooperation can continue.\\n\\n\\tThere are still many maritime disputes unsettled in this world, and the South China Sea issue is not the only one. China and ASEAN countries should be fully aware of the complexity and long-term nature of the South China Sea issue, and have confidence and patience for negotiation and consultation. Pending the final settlement, China and ASEAN countries should actively carry out practical cooperation on the sea, uphold peace and stability in the South China Sea through cooperation, and make sure that freedom of navigation and overflight is not affected. We also hope that countries outside this region, including the US, will move toward the same goal with China and ASEAN countries and support closer regional cooperation, not the other way round.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2016/0608/c98649-9069727.html'}\n"

(Xinhua/Xing Guangli)\\n\\n\\tNEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A recent New York Times editorial that criticized China\\'s rightful territorial claims in South China Sea is misleading by misconstruing and ignoring facts and international norms, said Ben Reynolds, a U.S. foreign policy analyst.\\n\\n\\tThe Times editorial, \"Playing Chicken in the South China Sea,\" accused China of escalating tensions between itself, its neighbors, and the United States.\\n\\n\\tThe editorial has vastly overstated the importance of the South China Sea to an audience that is increasingly skeptical of overseas interventions, argued Reynolds in a column piece with China-US Focus, an open-platform website focusing on China-U.S. relations based in Hong Kong.\\n\\n\\tOVERINFLATING THE SEA\\'S IMPORTANCE\\n\\n\\tThe editorial misstated and overly exaggerated the fact of the South China Sea being rich in resources, wrote Reynolds, pointing out that the only resource currently being extracted from the region in significant quantities is fish.\\n\\n\\tRegarding other energy resources like oil and natural gas, the vast majority of their reserves lie outside disputed areas according to the U.S. Energy Information administration, wrote the columnist.\\n\\n\\tReynolds acknowledged the argument that the South China Sea is of vital strategic importance because it contains major trade flows is partially correct, but he argued that no party to the territorial disputes believes or suggests that China\\'s claims pose a threat to peacetime trade.\\n\\n\\tIGNORING FACTS\\n\\n\\tThe Times editorial blamed China\\'s land reclamation and construction activities in the South China Sea as an \"aggressive and outrageous tactic,\" but it ignored the fact that U.S. allies and partners involved in the dispute have also expanded or constructed islands in the South China Sea in recent years, argued Reynolds.\\n\\n\\tReynolds continued his rebuttal on the Times\\' innuendo from bringing up China\\'s rising military budget, noting that the editorial deliberately omitted the fact that the 2015 U.S. military budget was 601 billion U.S. dollars, more than three times than that of China.\\n\\n\\tReynolds pointed out that the Times editors offered little criticism on the United States\\' own astronomical military budget and its deployments in the Asia-Pacific.\\n\\n\\t\"I should not have to remind the reader, much less the editors of a major global newspaper, that the United States is not located in Asia,\" wrote Reynolds.\\n\\n\\tMOUTHPIECE FOR U.S. INTERVENTIONIST FOREIGN POLICY\\n\\n\\tReynolds proceeded to point out the hypocrisy of the editorial\\'s argument that China is attempting to dangerously revise the post-World War II international norms.\\n\\n\\tThe argument ignored the fact that the post-war order in Asia was designed by the United States to hedge against the influence of the Soviet Union, wrote Reynolds. \"It was not designed to promote freedom and democracy\".\\n\\n\\t\"Again, we see that the object of the Times\\' critique is not militarism, threatening behavior, or the revision of international norms as such...Rather, the Times is critiquing Chinese behavior because China is a geopolitical rival of the United States,\" wrote Reynolds.\\n\\n\\tMisleading the American people about U.S.-China rivalry in the South China Sea with omissions and half-truths is the job of the Defense Department, not the press, said Reynolds.\\n\\n\\tThe New York Times has been on the wrong side of history in almost every proposed foreign intervention since World War II, which in its history endorsed the Vietnam War, the 2003 Iraq War, and the bombing of Libya, according to the columnist.\\n\\n\\t\"Let us hope that the New York Times is more thorough and careful with the facts in future pieces, lest it sell the American public on yet another disastrous foreign intervention.\"', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2016/0601/c90883-9066769.html'}\n",

We ratified 11 treaties and agreements with foreign countries or international conventions that China had concluded, and made decisions on or approved the appointment or removal of a number of officials of state bodies. Making progress and achievements in all aspects of our work, we have accomplished all the tasks set forth at the Third Session of the 12th NPC in 2015.\\n\\n\\tLeadership by the Party is the essential feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as its greatest strength. We have incorporated the leadership of the Party into every process and aspect of the NPC\\'s work, upheld the centralized, unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee, and ensured that our thinking, actions, and politics all maintain a high degree of unity with the Central Committee headed by General Secretary Xi Jinping. In coordinating the NPC\\'s initiatives and activities concerning legislation, oversight, decision making, personnel appointments and dismissals, deputies, foreign relations, information and publicity, theoretical research, and contact with and guidance over local people\\'s congresses, we have maintained the right political direction and worked to ensure that the Party\\'s line, principles, policies, decisions, and plans are fully and effectively implemented in the work of the state, and that the Party can exercise leadership over the state and society through the organs of political power.\\n\\n\\t1. We made new strides in key areas of legislation.\\n\\n\\tThe law is of great value in the governance of a country, and good laws are a prerequisite for good governance. Focusing on the key task of raising the quality of legislation, we channeled great effort into advancing legislation in key areas. Large in number, considerable in weight, and rapid in pace, our initiatives in legislation led to a number of important achievements that have supported and promoted the country\\'s reform and development and ensured its stability.\\n\\n\\t1) Legislation on national security was enhanced.\\n\\n\\tThe National Security Law represents a comprehensive, overarching, and fundamental law in the field of national security, playing a central role in the establishment of a system of national security laws. Acting in line with the Party Central Committee\\'s overall plan for accelerating the development of rule of law in China\\'s national security efforts, the Standing Committee gave high priority to the enactment of a national security law which was passed after three deliberations. As an important piece of legislation, the National Security Law embodies an integrative approach to national security, and defines national security in the context of China\\'s conditions and realities. It sets out express provisions regarding the guiding notions, leadership system, basic principles, major tasks, and safeguard measures of China\\'s security initiatives, thus laying a solid legal foundation for accelerating the establishment of a national security system and taking a distinctly Chinese approach to national security.\\n\\n\\tThe fight against terrorism has an important bearing on China\\'s national security, on the people\\'s immediate interests, and on the country\\'s reform, development, and stability. In the face of a grave and complex situation in the fight against terrorism both at home and abroad, it is of crucial importance that China intensifies its anti-terrorism initiatives. With this in mind, the Standing Committee adopted the Anti-Terrorism Law in December 2015, through which we have defined the basic principles of China\\'s anti-terrorism initiatives, improved working systems and mechanisms in this regard, and stepped up anti-terrorism efforts with regard to preventive safety measures, emergency response, international cooperation, and supporting measures. Meanwhile, Amendment IX to the Criminal Law, passed by the Standing Committee, imposed criminal sanctions against five types of terrorism-related activities and introduced harsher punishments for crimes involving terrorism and extremism. The improvements to our counter-terrorism laws will be of great importance for preventing and punishing terrorist activities according to law, for safeguarding national and public security, and for protecting people\\'s lives and property.\\n\\n\\t2) Legislation pertaining to people\\'s wellbeing was pushed forward.\\n\\n\\tPutting the people first in legislation and making legislation for them is an important principle that we must uphold in our legislative work under present circumstances. In response to strong public complaints about serious air pollution such as the frequent occurrence of smog, the Standing Committee worked energetically to revise and improve relevant laws while continuing to strengthen oversight. In particular, we made comprehensive revisions to the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law in an effort to make the law significantly more targeted, practicable, and enforceable. Increasing the number of articles from 66 to 129, we made significant modifications and improvements to the law with a view to strengthening the obligations of the government, enterprises, and individual members of society in the prevention and control of air pollution. By upgrading prevention and control standards, tightening total emissions control, and improving the emissions permit system, the revised law enhanced the prevention and control of pollution from coal burning, industry, vehicle and vessel exhaust emissions, wind-borne dust, and agriculture. It also refined systems for coordinating intra-regional prevention and control efforts in key regions and for responding to heavy air pollution.\\n\\n\\tThe people will not be content until they have confidence in the safety of the food they are eating. In a bid to establish the strictest possible oversight and supervision system for food safety, one that covers the whole process from production to consumption, the Standing Committee took prompt steps to revise the Food Safety Law, taking particular aim at prominent food safety problems. With an emphasis on preventing and reducing safety risks, the revised law has improved basic systems pertaining to safety standards and the monitoring and assessment of safety risks. It brings the whole process from food production and distribution to catering under supervision, and tightens legal penalties for the unlawful production and sale of food and for neglect and dereliction of food safety supervision duties. It also prescribes the establishment of a society-wide co-governance system for food safety that comprises the provision of rewards for reporting food safety problems, the release of food safety information, and the introduction of a food safety liability insurance, so that every member of society is encouraged to lawfully ensure that every bite of food is safe.\\n\\n\\tOpposition to domestic violence is an important indicator of social progress, and an essential requirement for harmonious families and a stable society. In September 2015, at the Global Leaders\\' Meeting on Gender Equality and Women\\'s Empowerment, President Xi Jinping stated, \"We will strive to eliminate all forms of violence against women, including domestic abuse.\" The Anti-Domestic Violence Law formulated by the Standing Committee emphasizes that the prevention of domestic violence is the shared responsibility of the state, society, and each family. The law has not only stipulated mechanisms and measures for preventing and dealing with domestic abuse, but has also introduced a system of restraining orders to protect the victims of family violence, thereby providing a stronger legal guarantee for preventing domestic violence against women, minors, and other groups and preserving equal, harmonious, and amiable family relations.\\n\\n\\tWe also made timely changes to the Population and Family Planning Law. In order to put into effect the decision made at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee to comprehensively implement a policy of allowing all couples to have two children, the Standing Committee issued a decision on revising the Population and Family Planning Law, implementing a universal two-child policy as of January 1, 2016. The revised law explicitly stipulates that all couples are allowed to have two children. Those couples who had observed the previous one-child policy and are still willing to have only one child in their lifetime shall be eligible for a certificate of honor, which entitles them to benefits and assistance as stipulated. As a response to the major demographic shift that has taken place in China, the revision of the Population and Family Planning Law represents a major change to China\\'s birth policy, and is a move that will have far-reaching effects on our efforts to promote the balanced development of China\\'s population.\\n\\n\\t3) The criminal law system was improved.\\n\\n\\tWith a view to implementing the guidelines on deepening judicial reform issued by the CPC Central Committee, and in an effort to adapt to new circumstances and requirements pertaining to criminal justice, the Standing Committee deliberated and passed the 52-article Amendment IX to the Criminal Law, making considerable revisions and improvements to the law. The revisions mainly involve abolishing capital punishment for nine crimes that rarely saw the sentence applied; improving legal regulations for punishing embezzlement and bribery, with a paragraph stipulating the applicability of life imprisonment and inapplicability of commutation or parole for a specific circumstance; imposing heavier punishments on cybercrime; strengthening protection of the rights of the person for women, minors, and the elderly; making it a crime to disrupt courtroom order, organize cheating in examinations, organize or fund illegal assemblies, or fabricate or purposefully disseminate false information; and repealing the crime of having paid sex with a girl under the age of 14,instead treating such an act as a case of rape in which stringency should be shown under the relevant stipulations of the Criminal Law.\\n\\n\\t4) Legislative work in other areas was coordinated.\\n\\n\\tThe legislative power represents one of the most important functions and powers of the NPC. Following its submission of the draft revisions of the Legislation Law to the Third Session of the 12th NPC for deliberation in 2015, this year the Standing Committee has submitted the draft of the Charity Law to this session for deliberation on the basis of thorough preparations. The drafting of the law was overseen by the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee. The Standing Committee has deliberated the draft twice, solicited comments from the public on two separate occasions, and made careful revisions accordingly before submitting it to this session for deliberation.\\n\\n\\tIn addition, the Standing Committee formulated the Law on the Exploration and Development of Deep Seafloor Resources; revised the Advertising Law, the Seed Law, the Law on Promoting the Application of Scientific and Technological Advances, the Education Law, and the Higher Education Law; and deliberated draft legislation including a law on the management of international NGOs in China, a cyber-security law, a revision of the Securities Law, an asset evaluation law, amendments to the Law on the Promotion of Privately-Run Schools, a revision of the Wildlife Protection Law, a film industry promotion law, and a law on traditional Chinese medicine.\\n\\n\\tAttaching high priority to and acting in line with the concept of effective and democratic legislation, the Standing Committee engaged in vigorous efforts to refine legislative mechanisms and systems with a view to making our legislative work more systemic, timely, targeted, and effective.\\n\\n\\tFirst, with the approval of the CPC Central Committee, adjustments were made to the five-year legislative plan of the current Standing Committee, principally to include into the plan legislative items pertaining to the coordinated implementation of the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy. As a result, the total number of legislative items in category I (draft legislation ready for deliberation by the Standing Committee) and category II (draft legislation soon to be ready for deliberation by the Standing Committee) increased from 68 to 102.\\n\\n\\tSecond, we intensified the research and evaluation of legislative items, and carried out dedicated deliberations on key points and difficulties in the drafts of the National Security Law and the Anti-Terrorism Law as well as in the draft revisions of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law and the Advertising Law.\\n\\n\\tThird, giving full play to the role of NPC deputies, we improved mechanisms for soliciting their opinions on draft laws and invited them to participate in the debate, research, and deliberation process.\\n\\n\\tFourth, in a bid to broaden channels for the systematic participation of citizens in the legislative process, we formulated the Procedures for Releasing Drafts of Laws for Public Comments, according to which the drafts of laws for the first and second deliberations of the Standing Committee should both be promptly made available to the public. After the draft of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law was released, for example, we received more than 40,000 comments and suggestions from all sectors of society. We also put in place a sound system whereby specialists are appointed as legislative advisors, thereby further improving our consultation system for legislative decision making.\\n\\n\\tFifth, we actively responded to the concerns of NPC deputies, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People\\'s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and people from all sectors of society, studying and incorporating where possible the comments and suggestions of all sides into the relevant laws as they were drafted, deliberated, or revised.\\n\\n\\tSixth, we established a system of staying connected with local communities on legislative issues, making full use of the role of this system in directly soliciting the legislation-related views of the general public and officials at the community level.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x904ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x905ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x906ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x907ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x908ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x909ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2016/0320/c90785-9032747.html'}\n"

      "901,{'發稿日': ['March18', '2016'], '新聞標題': 'Full Text: Report on the Work of the Government', '作者': 'Xinhua', '新聞內文': \"Following is the full text of the Report on the Work of the Government delivered by Premier Li Keqiang at the Fourth Session of the Twelfth National People's Congress on March 5, 2016 and adopted on March 16, 2016:\\n\\n\\tREPORT ON THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT\\n\\n\\tDelivered at the Fourth Session of the 12th National People's Congress of\\n\\n\\tthe People's Republic of China on March 5, 2016\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang\\n\\n\\tPremier of the State Council\\n\\n\\tEsteemed Deputies,\\n\\n\\tOn behalf of the State Council, I will now report to you on the work of the government for your deliberation and approval. I invite comments on my report from the members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).\\n\\n\\tLet me start with a review of the work we did in 2015.\\n\\n\\tIn the past year, China has encountered many difficulties and challenges in its development. However, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) headed by General Secretary Xi Jinping, and with confidence and courage, all the people of China have worked to overcome obstacles and have pressed ahead with a pioneering spirit. As a result, progress has been achieved and stability ensured in economic and social development, the main tasks and targets for the year have been fulfilled, and major achievements have been made in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.\\n\\n\\t-- The economy operated within an appropriate range.\\n\\n\\tGDP reached 67.7 trillion yuan, representing an increase of 6.9% over the previous year-a growth rate faster than that of most other major economies. Food crop production increased for the 12th year in a row. Consumer prices grew slowly. Of particular note, the employment situation overall remained stable, with 13.12 million new urban jobs created over the course of the year, surpassing the year's target and becoming an economic highlight.\\n\\n\\t-- Encouraging progress was made in structural adjustment.\\n\\n\\tThe service sector as a proportion of GDP rose to 50.5%, accounting for more than half for the first time. The contribution of consumption toward economic growth reached 66.4%. High-tech industries and equipment manufacturing grew faster than other industries. Energy consumption per unit of GDP fell by 5.6%.\\n\\n\\t-- New driving forces for development grew rapidly.\\n\\n\\tFurther progress was made in implementing the strategy of innovation-driven development,the penetration of the Internet into all industries picked up pace, and emerging industries grew rapidly. Business startups and innovations by the general public flourished, with the number of newly registered businesses rising by 21.6% in 2015, or an average of 12,000 new businesses per day. New driving forces played a major role in keeping employment stable and pushing ahead industry upgrading, and are now driving profound economic and social change in China.\\n\\n\\t-- Living standards improved.\\n\\n\\tPersonal per capita disposable income increased by 7.4% in real terms, overtaking the growth rate of the economy. By the end of last year, personal savings deposits had risen by 8.5%, an increase of more than four trillion yuan. In rural areas, another 64.34 million people gained access to safe drinking water and greater alleviation efforts reduced the number of people living in poverty by 14.42 million.\\n\\n\\tA number of world-class innovations were made in science and technology.Major headway was made in the development of 3G nuclear power technology, China's self-developed C919 large jetliner rolled off the assembly line, and Tu Youyou was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.\\n\\n\\tThese achievements in China's development, a source of pride and motivation for our people, did not come easily.\\n\\n\\tThey were made in the context of an extremely complicated and challenging international environment. In 2015, world economic growth fell to its lowest rate in six years, growth in international trade slowed, commodity prices plummeted, and there was growing volatility in the global financial market. All this had a direct impact on China's economy.\\n\\n\\tThey were made at the same time as deep-seated domestic problems were becoming prominent and downward pressure on the economy was mounting. While dealing with the slowdown in economic growth, making difficult structural adjustments, and absorbing the effects of previous economic stimulus policies, China was also confronted with many difficult problems and choices in the running of the economy, and this called for effective responses based on the need both to combine long-term and short-term considerations and to seek benefit and avoid harm.\\n\\n\\tFinally, they were made at a time when China's economic output had exceeded 60 trillion yuan. Every percentage point of GDP growth today is equivalent to 1.5 percentage points of growth five years ago or 2.5 percentage points of growth ten years ago. The larger the economy grows, the greater the difficulty of achieving growth.\\n\\n\\tIn the face of these difficulties and pressures, all our people have truly exerted themselves and progressed step by step to get us where we are today. This once again demonstrates that no difficulty or hardship will ever stop China from moving forward.\\n\\n\\tI will now move on to discuss the main work we did last year:\\n\\n\\tFirst, we maintained stable growth, made structural adjustments, guarded against risks, and developed new ways of conducting macro regulation.\\n\\n\\tIn responding to the mounting downward pressure on the economy, we exercised targeted and well-timed regulation on the basis of range-based regulation. We adopted proactive fiscal policy that focused on increasing intensity and efficacy by expanding the scope of structural tax reductions, reducing fees across the board, and putting dormant budgetary funds to good use. Local government bonds issued to replace outstanding debt reached 3.2 trillion yuan, lessening the interest payment burden of local governments by approximately 200 billion yuan while also reducing their debt repayment pressure. We pursued prudent monetary policy with an appropriate amount of intensity, making several cuts to interest rates and required reserve ratios, reforming management of the loan-to-deposit ratio, creating new monetary policy tools, and increasing support for the real economy. Effective investment increased, special-purpose funds were established, and development was strengthened in areas in need of attention, including water conservancy, rundown urban areas and dilapidated rural housing, and railways and highways in the central and western regions. Consumer spending was promoted in key areas, spurring rapid growth in spending on recreational travel, online shopping, and information goods and services. In 2015, we also responded proactively to a variety of risks and challenges in the financial sector, such as unusual fluctuations in the stock market and the foreign exchange market, ensuring that no systemic or regional threats arose, thus safeguarding China's economic and financial security.\\n\\n\\tSecond, we intensified reform and opening up to invigorate the market.\\n\\n\\tRather than adopting strong stimulus policies that would have an economy-wide impact, we continued to move forward with structural reform. We intensified reform to streamline administration, delegate more powers, improve regulation, and provide better services. We delegated the power or cancelled the requirement for government review for 311 items, cancelled the requirement for verification or approval for 123 professional qualifications, and put a complete stop to the practice of non-administrative review. The number of items which require government approval for new businesses prior to registration was cut by 85%, and the system of a separate business license, organization code certificate, and taxation registration certificate was replaced by a unified business license with a unified social credit code. Both operational and post-operational oversight over businesses were strengthened, and public service procedures were improved. Government-related procedures for individuals and businesses were made much simpler, such that enthusiasm for stepping out into business and making innovations is rising by the day.\\n\\n\\tFiscal, tax, financial, and other key reforms were deepened. The central government cut, by one third, the number of items for which special transfer payments are permitted, while scaling up its general transfer payments. Steady progress was made in replacing business tax with VAT. Ad valorem taxation was extended to cover more types of resource taxes. The upper limit of the floating band on deposit rates was removed, the deposit insurance system was introduced, and the RMB cross-border payment system was established. Pricing reform was intensified, with the number of central government set prices reduced by 80% and the number of local government set prices cut by more than 50%. We carried out state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms, rural reforms, and investment and financing reforms, ecological management reforms, and others. Efforts to intensify reform in all respects are beginning to deliver results.\\n\\n\\tMomentum was created for reform and development through opening up. We worked hard to keep foreign trade stable by adjusting the mechanism for sharing the cost of export tax rebates between the central and local governments, overhauling and regulating charges for imports and exports, increasing trade facilitation, and making changes to the export mix. The number of restrictions on overseas investment in China was cut by 50%, and over 95% of overseas-funded projects may now be undertaken on a simple reporting basis. China utilized US$126.3 billion of overseas investment, an increase of 5.6%. Non-financial outward foreign direct investment reached $118 billion, up 14.7%. Pilot free trade zones were established in Guangdong, Tianjin, and Fujian based on the model of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone. The RMB was included in the IMF's Special Drawing Rights basket. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was officially inaugurated, and the Silk Road Fund opened for business. China signed free trade agreements with the Republic of Korea and Australia, respectively,and signed the Protocol to Amend the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Cooperation between China and ASEAN. Progress was made in the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative (the Belt and Road Initiative), the pace of our industrial-capacity cooperation with other countries was stepped up, and breakthroughs were made in China's export of high-speed railway and nuclear power equipment.\\n\\n\\tThird, we worked to promote industrial innovation and upgrading to improve economic performance.\\n\\n\\tTo strengthen the new growth engines, an innovation-driven development plan was adopted along with guidelines on its implementation, policies and measures were introduced to encourage public participation in starting businesses and making innovations, and the Internet Plus action plan was implemented. A great number of makers started businesses and made innovations. Improvements were made to policies in support of agriculture to promote transformation of the agricultural growth model. In addressing the decline in industrial growth and the downward slide incorporate performance, we worked to foster new industries and upgrade traditional ones. We launched the Made in China 2025 initiative to upgrade manufacturing, set up government funds to encourage investment in emerging industries and to develop small and medium-sized enterprises, and established more national innovation demonstration zones. We cut overcapacity and encouraged business acquisitions and restructuring. Cuts made in outdated production capacity over the past three years have included over 90 million metric tons of steel and iron, 230 million metric tons of cement, over 76 million weight cases of plate glass, and more than one million metric tons of electrolytic aluminum. The development of production- and consumer-oriented service industries picked up momentum. We took serious measures to conserve energy, reduce emissions, and protect the environment, exceeding obligatory targets. We released self-imposed emissions reduction targets and contributed to the positive outcomes of international negotiations on climate change.\\n\\n\\tFourth, we promoted coordinated development between regions and the new type of urbanization to expand development space.\\n\\n\\tWork continued to promote the coordinated development of the eastern region, the central region, the western region, and the northeast; priority was placed on moving forward with the Three Initiatives-the Belt and Road Initiative, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration initiative, and the Yangtze Economic Belt initiative. A number of major projects were also launched to develop infrastructure, improve the distribution of industries, and achieve ecological and environmental conservation. Policies and measures were introduced to promote the development of Tibet, Xinjiang, and Tibetan ethnic areas in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Qinghai. We pressed ahead with the reform of the household registration system, adopted a residence certification system, and stepped up the development of urban infrastructure, making progress in developing new urbanization.\\n\\n\\tFifth, we promoted the reform and development of social programs to improve living standards.\\n\\n\\tDespite fiscal constraints, we continued to intensify efforts to help ensure the wellbeing of our people. New policies were launched to create jobs and business startup opportunities for college graduates and those with difficulties finding employment. Over the course of the year, 7.72 million government-subsidized housing units were basically completed in urban areas, work started on the reconstruction of 6.01 million housing units in rundown urban areas, and 4.32 million dilapidated houses in rural areas were rebuilt, helping large numbers of families that are struggling with housing realize their dream of having a home to settle in. We moved more quickly to improve conditions in badly built and poorly operated schools providing compulsory education in poor areas, deepened the reform of the professional title system for elementary and secondary school teachers, and increased the number of students from poor rural areas who were enrolled in key institutions of higher learning by a further 10.5%. Comprehensive reform was carried out in all public hospitals at the county level, the coverage of the serious disease insurance scheme was extended to more rural and non-working urban residents, a system of assistance for treating major and serious diseases was put in place, and a system for providing living allowances for people with disabilities who are in need and for granting nursing care subsidies to persons with severe disabilities was established. We increased subsistence allowances, benefits for entitled groups, and basic pension benefits for enterprise retirees, implemented the reform of the pension system for employees of Party and government offices and public institutions, and improved their wage system. Efforts to develop basic public cultural services were also intensified. All of this has resulted in a stronger sense of benefit in society.\\n\\n\\tSixth, we developed new ways of conducting law-based administration and governance to promote social harmony and stability.\\n\\n\\tThe State Council submitted 11 legislative proposals to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and enacted or revised eight sets of administrative regulations. Efforts were accelerated to increase government transparency and expand the application of e-government and online administration. We set up a mechanism to inspect and establish accountability for the implementation of major government policies and introduced third-party evaluations. We responded effectively to natural disasters and emergencies. Efforts were stepped up to ensure workplace safety; as a result, we have seen a continued reduction in the number of total accidents, including the number of accidents of a serious or large-scale nature as well as those in industries where accidents tend to be more common. We moved ahead with the demonstration initiative to ensure food safety. We strengthened all-round efforts to maintain law and order and cracked down on crimes in accordance with the law to safeguard public security.\\n\\n\\tThe campaign to build understanding of the Three Stricts and Three Honests* was intensified, the CPC Central Committee's eight-point decision on improving Party and government conduct continued to be implemented, action was taken against formalism, bureaucratism, hedonism, and extravagance, and rigorous efforts were made to carry out the State Council's three-point decision on curbing government spending. Administrative supervision and oversight through auditing were strengthened. We stepped up efforts to improve Party conduct and government integrity and fight corruption, and brought a number of offenders to justice.\\n\\n\\tWe marked the 70th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the Global War against Fascism. This anniversary was a reminder of China's place in history as the main theater in the East during the Global War against Fascism and its major contribution to the war effort. The Chinese people marked this occasion to demonstrate their dedication to safeguarding peace and upholding justice together with other peoples.\\n\\n\\tOver the past year, China's all-round diplomacy has delivered fruitful outcomes. President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders have visited many countries and attended international events including the United Nations summits, the G20 Leaders Summit, the 23rd APEC Economic Leaders Meeting, the 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the East Asian leaders' meetings on cooperation, and the World Economic Forum annual meeting 2016. The Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the China-EU Leaders' Meeting were held, and the China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) Forum was inaugurated. Fresh progress was made in China's relations with other major countries; pragmatic cooperation with neighboring countries was strengthened; friendship and cooperation with other developing countries grew; relations with the United Nations and other international organizations and mechanisms were strengthened in all areas; and notable achievements were made in economic diplomacy and cultural exchanges. As a responsible major country, China played an important constructive role in international and regional affairs.\\n\\n\\tWe owe these achievements to the sound overall decisions made by the CPC Central Committee headed by General Secretary Xi Jinping, and to the concerted and determined efforts of all members of the Party, all members of the armed forces, and all the people of China. On behalf of the State Council, I wish to express our sincere gratitude to the people of all ethnic groups in China including public figures from all sectors of society and to the other parties and the people's organizations. I express our heartfelt appreciation to our fellow countrymen and women in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and in Taiwan, and to Chinese nationals overseas. I also wish to express our sincere thanks to the governments, international organizations, and friends from all over the world who have shown understanding and support for China in her endeavor to modernize.\\n\\n\\tWhile recognizing our achievements, we are also keenly aware that our country is still confronted with many difficulties and problems in pursuing development. With the decline in global trade, amongst other factors, China experienced a fall in its total imports and exports and failed to reach its growth objective in this regard. Growth in investment is sluggish, overcapacity is a serious problem in certain industries, some enterprises are facing difficulties in production and operations, growth prospects are mixed for different regions and different industries, notable imbalances exist between government revenue and expenditures, the basic institutions for the capital market still need to be improved, and there are latent risks in the financial and other sectors. There are many problems in medical care, education, elderly care, food and medicine safety, income distribution, and urban management that are of concern to the people. The situation remains grave when it comes to environmental pollution, and some regions are frequently hit by severe smog. Particularly distressing, last year saw the sinking of the cruise ship Oriental Star on the Yangtze and the massive explosion in Tianjin Port. The deaths and injuries and the damage and loss of property from these incidents were devastating, and the profound lessons these incidents have taught us should never be forgotten. There are still inadequacies in the work of the government. Some reforms, policies, and measures have not been fully implemented; a small number of government employees either do not or are unable to fulfill their duties, or behave irresponsibly; and the corruption and misconduct in some sectors cannot be ignored. We must be more mindful of the difficulties ahead, more ready to assume responsibility, and more hardworking in ensuring these problems are solved. The wishes of the people should always determine the aim of our governance; we must do our utmost to deliver a strong performance in our work and never fail to live up to the great trust the people have placed in us.\\n\\n\\tEsteemed Deputies,\\n\\n\\tThe period covered by the 12th Five-Year Plan came to a close in 2015. During the past five years, impressive achievements were made in China's development. Since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, we have found ourselves in a complicated international environment, and we have faced the challenging tasks of carrying out reform and development and maintaining stability at home. However, under the guidance of the CPC Central Committee headed by General Secretary Xi Jinping, we have continued our commitment to the general principle of making progress while working to keep performance stable, deepened reform and opening up, and adopted a series of major measures that should deliver both immediate and long-term benefits. As a result, we successfully fulfilled all the main tasks and targets set out in the 12th Five-Year Plan.\\n\\n\\tFirst, a high rate of economic development was maintained.\\n\\n\\tDuring this period, China's GDP grew at an average annual rate of 7.8%. This growth enabled China to comfortably maintain its position as the world's second-largest economy, and become the largest trading nation in terms of goods as well as a major outbound investor.\\n\\n\\tSecond, milestone progress was achieved in structural adjustments.\\n\\n\\tService industries have grown to be the largest economic sector, information technology has been further integrated into industrialization, and overall agricultural production capacity has notably improved. Consumption has become a major driver of growth. Over half of China's population now resides in urban areas.

(Xinhua/Luo Huanhuan)\\n\\n\\tUS THAAD system in S.Korea will complicate situation\\n\\n\\tChina will not follow the US in imposing unilateral sanctions on North Korea, and the possible deployment of an advanced US missile defense system in South Korea will only complicate the security situation in the Asia-Pacific region, observers said.\\n\\n\\tMeeting with US Secretary of State John Kerry on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday made clear China\\'s opposition to the possible deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea.\\n\\n\\tAs one of the most advanced missile defense systems in the world, THAAD can intercept and destroy ballistic missiles inside or just outside the atmosphere during their final phase of flight, according to the Xinhua News Agency.\\n\\n\\tDespite claims by Washington and Seoul that the missile shield would be focused solely on North Korea, analysts warn that the deployment would pose a considerable threat to neighboring countries, especially China and Russia.\\n\\n\\t\"The latest North Korean nuclear test has served to assist the US\\' intended deployment of THAAD, which will become a direct threat to both China and Russia. Both countries will not let their guard down against South Korea after the deployment,\" said LÃ¼ Chao, a professor at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences.\\n\\n\\tThe US and South Korea began talks on the deployment of THAAD, hours after North Korea carried out on February 7 what it said was a satellite launch but which others believe was a missile test.\\n\\n\\tThe Pentagon has since stressed that it would like the anti-missile system to be deployed in South Korea \"as quickly as possible.\"\\n\\n\\tThere is already a THAAD battery stationed in Guam and the other key US ally in the region, Japan, is also considering taking on the system.\\n\\n\\tBroader agenda\\n\\n\\t\"The deployment of the THAAD system by the US ... goes far beyond the defense needs of the Korean Peninsula and the coverage would mean it will reach deep into the Asian continent,\" Wang said in an interview with Reuters.\\n\\n\\t\"It doesn\\'t require experts. Ordinary people know that the deployment of the THAAD system is not just to defend South Korea, but a wider agenda and may even be meant for China,\" Wang said, urging the US side to act cautiously, not to undermine China\\'s security interests or add new complications to regional peace and stability.\\n\\n\\tThe North will not be threatened by either THAAD or nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Instead, the country will only enjoy more strategic opportunities when THAAD leads to conflicts between major powers including China, Russia and the US, LÃ¼ noted.\\n\\n\\t\"It\\'s clear that the US is trying to promote its rebalance to the Asia-Pacific.

Third, China will not allow its legitimate interests including in national security interests to be undermined,\" Wang said.\\n\\n\\tChina\\'s three principles do not suggest a changing attitude in Chinese foreign policy toward North Korea, but reflect a continuance of foreign policy, with more specific details on its opposition to nuclearization and militarization, according to LÃ¼.\\n\\n\\t\"It also shows China\\'s stance, which is different from the US, will not create chaos and conflicts,\" LÃ¼ noted.\\n\\n\\tChina and the US have agreed to speed up the consultation process at the UN Security Council to reach a new resolution and take strong and effective measures to deter the further development of nuclear and missile programs by North Korea, Wang said in his meeting with Kerry.\\n\\n\\tWhen asked whether Beijing was ready to support stronger economic sanctions, Wang said the resolution would be wide-ranging, but its objective should be to curb Pyongyang\\'s efforts to develop nuclear and missile technologies.\\n\\n\\t\"Sanctions are not the end, the purpose should be to make sure that the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula be brought back to a negotiation-based resolution,\" he said, adding that China will back a UN Security Council solution to make North Korea \"pay the necessary price.\"\\n\\n\\tLÃ¼ said that this is one of the sternest declarations from China and the nation will strictly follow the UN resolution.\\n\\n\\tHowever, Beijing will not follow the US in imposing unilateral sanctions on North Korea outside the UN framework, which is against China\\'s interests and the spirit of humanitarianism, he said.\\n\\n\\tNorth Korea has been under UN sanctions since its first nuclear test in 2006.\\n\\n\\t\"Our policy on the North is not weak and we will not tolerate challenges and provocation from the North. But it is groundless to demand a reaction from China similar to the US\\',\" LÃ¼ noted.\\n\\n\\tLÃ¼ added that China is North Korea\\'s largest trading partner, but a complete shutdown of bilateral trade will trigger a crisis similar to the European migrant crisis, which will in turn affect China and South Korea.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2016/0214/c90883-9016167.html'}\n",

Since the international financial crisis in 2008, the fragility and differentiation of weak recovery of world economy have been obvious.\\n\\n\\tBesides, many weaknesses of the global economic governance system are still serious and the lack of coordination and even contradiction of major economiesâ\\x80\\x99 policies are bound to further increase the overall risks of the world economy.\\n\\n\\tThe United States and China, as two largest economies with more than one-third of the world economic aggregate, have played key roles in containing the spead of risks, promoting world economic recovery and cooperating to improve global economic governance system.\\n\\n\\tCurrently, China and the United States need to help each other to overcome domestic resistance, speed up the pace of our own economic transformation and upgrading, expand cooperation including international capacity to promote effective and sustainable demand of the world economy, promote the opening up and universal benefits of global multilateral trade and investment system, actively resolve systemic risks in the international financial system, and jointly promote the reform and development of global economic governance mechanism.\\n\\n\\tTo strengthen understanding and mutual trust between China and the United States will be the basis for building a balanced, stable and effective international security system, especially in the Asia-pacific.\\n\\n\\tAt present, security threats and challenges interweave, competition and mutual dependence in the field of international security upgrade simultaneously, but military security alliances based on the concept of zero-sum game and confrontation is still in vogue.\\n\\n\\tIt should be noted that Cold War mentality and exclusive â\\x80\\x9ccirclesâ\\x80\\x9d not only exacerbate strategic doubts and security dilemma between countries, but also restrict the great potential of countries in expanding security cooperation and coping with the increasingly complex security challenges.\\n\\n\\tChina and the United States should have innovative thinking, overcome bottlenecks in cooperation in the field of military security, determine our security goals with â\\x80\\x9crelative safetyâ\\x80\\x9d rather than â\\x80\\x9cabsolute securityâ\\x80\\x9d, define our scope of security interests with â\\x80\\x9ccommon securityâ\\x80\\x9d rather than â\\x80\\x9cunilateral securityâ\\x80\\x9d, design the approach and mechanism for maintaining regional and international security with â\\x80\\x9ccooperation and safetyâ\\x80\\x9d rather than â\\x80\\x9czero-sum confrontationâ\\x80\\x9d and make the security order in the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world develop towards a more balanced, stable and efficient direction.\\n\\n\\tAs the breadth and depth of global governance expand increasingly, international community has growing consciousness of globalization-based communities of shared interests and responsibilities. On the other hand, the inclusion of a batch of new public domains including ocean, internet, space and polar areas not only further highlights the complexity of competition and asymmetry of global governance, but also intensifies the contradiction between international societyâ\\x80\\x99s demand for fair and efficient governance and the current global governance undersupply .\\n\\n\\tChina and the United States are the two key variables that affect the development of global governance, so our coordination not only can provide a great deal of material public goods for global governance, but also can give full play to the characteristics of our complementary advantages, jointly cope with the major threats and challenges faced by sustainable development, including climate change, energy resource security, water, soil and food security through innovative management, promote the establishment of rules and regulations in global governance.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n/2015/0928/c90000-8956342.html'}\n"

Against the backdrop of difficulties in the South China Sea, the â\\x80\\x9cNew Normalâ\\x80\\x9d in the economy, and accusations over cyber theft, will the future course of relations between the two powers be smooth? Are both committed to keeping ties on a steady track? Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s Daily asked several experts for their opinion.\\n\\n\\tYuan Peng, vice president of China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations\\n\\n\\tIn the China-US relationship, two great powers, which differ in social system, ideology, values, development phase, history and culture, have been able to maintain a peaceful and stable relationship for over 30 years since the normalization of the diplomatic ties.\\n\\n\\tThis has created a framework for a new model of major power relationship. What we are doing now is to theorize and enrich the connotation of this relationship, gearing it to the needs of the future, so as to keep the China-US relationship on a stable and continuously advancing track.\\n\\n\\tBilateral economic and trade ties, as in the past, will put the overall China-US relationship on more solid footing. Currently, the China-US trade stands at nearly $560 billion. The figure speaks a thousand words.\\n\\n\\tItâ\\x80\\x99s estimated that the two countries could tap a further $500 billion in trade potential in the next decade. Such enormous benefits are very likely to bind China and the US into a community of common interest and a state of profound interdependence that is hard to break.\\n\\n\\tIn addition, there is also huge potential to be tapped in investment terms, which is why China is actively pushing the signing of the Bilateral Investment Treaty as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\tThe US and China, both permanent members of the UN Security Council, the worldâ\\x80\\x99s biggest and second biggest economies, and the biggest developed country and developing country, will change the world if they proceed hand in hand. China-US cooperation cannot solve all global issues, but none of the problems can be solved without China-US cooperation.\\n\\n\\tShen Dingli, vice dean of the Institute of International Affairs at Fudan University\\n\\n\\tThe US, shortly after the founding of the nation, established trade contact with China. The seeds of the now all-important US-China trade relationship were sown over 200 years ago, when the Empress of China, a ship commissioned by first US president George Washington, set sail from New York en route to Canton (Guangzhou).\\n\\n\\tWashington was pleased by the news of the shipâ\\x80\\x99s return and spent $200 on the Chinese goods it brought back.\\n\\n\\tNow, in 2014, the volume of trade in goods between China and the US has amounted to $560 billion and the two countries have become important trading partners to each other. With the development of both countries, the demand for expanding cooperation is further increasing.\\n\\n\\tMutually beneficial cooperation has laid a solid foundation for the state-state cooperation and could benefit the people of both countries. The China-US relationship is not an empty concept, but one that has rich connotations.\\n\\n\\tDouglas H. Paal, vice president of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\\n\\n\\tWe need cooperation at least at two levels: first, far sighted statesmanship and a commitment to find ways to make room for each other in the Asia-Pacific region and in international bodies, not to exclude each other; and the leaders need to signal that they are determined to pursue economic reform and re-balancing and that they are convinced they can contribute together to global growth.\\n\\n\\tThe second level is concrete accomplishments to address nagging issues such as cyber intrusions, frictions in the South and East China Seas, and the climate for foreign commerce and investment.\\n\\n\\tChina is only just beginning to extend its global reach. The number of areas where it can make a contribution is relatively small, but growing.\\n\\n\\tThe US must accustom itself to thinking of China as a necessary part of the equation leading to peace and development. And the US must think about what it says and does in terms of how China will view it.\\n\\n\\tChina must not see areas of action as necessarily a zero sum game, or anything involving the US as another attempt to prevent Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s rise. We need to listen to each other more carefully.\\n\\n\\tFan Jishe, a research fellow at the Institute of American Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences\\n\\n\\tA solid foundation has been laid to construct a stable strategic relationship between China and the US. They have become politically and economically interdependent.\\n\\n\\tIn the middle and later periods of the Cold War, China and the US cooperated strategically to grapple with a common security threat; after that, they turned from cooperation on bilateral issues to interaction on multilateral and global issues for the sake of common interests and challenges.\\n\\n\\tAs China integrates with the current international order and expands its interests overseas in globalized times, maintaining a stable and prosperous international society serves the interests of both countries.\\n\\n\\tA rising China is dedicated to avoiding the Thucydides Trap and developing a relationship with the US that features no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. This is where the core value of their new type of major power relationship lies. In the over 36 years since the two countries established their diplomatic ties, one important feature of the bilateral relationship is to define and conceptualize it.\\n\\n\\tIn general, it was the US that used to define the direction of the Sino-US relationship and now China proposes to build a new model of major power relationship, an active try to develop their relations.\\n\\n\\tThe differences between China and the US mostly relate to sovereignty issues. They are politically sensitive and offer limited room for compromise. They are potential sources for confrontation and can be categorized as a â\\x80\\x9cred area,â\\x80\\x9d which can hardly be resolved in a short period.\\n\\n\\tBut the two countries have accumulated abundant experiences to deal with these bilateral differences. Their differences on regional issues are not as sensitive as on bilateral disputes and can be categorized as a â\\x80\\x9cyellow area,â\\x80\\x9d which has certain room for compromise. China and the US can narrow their differences if they handle the regional disputes properly; otherwise, these issues may also lead to conflicts.\\n\\n\\tOn global issues like climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, energy and pandemics, China and the US have many converging interests and fewer sensitive differences. This constitutes a â\\x80\\x9cgreen areaâ\\x80\\x9d that suggests broad prospects for cooperation.\\n\\n\\tBuilding the new type of major power relationship requires the two countries to expand their cooperation in â\\x80\\x9cgreen areaâ\\x80\\x9d issues, work together more on â\\x80\\x9cyellow areaâ\\x80\\x9d issues and gradually turn some of them into â\\x80\\x9cgreen areaâ\\x80\\x9d ones. They should effectively manage the differences over â\\x80\\x9cred areaâ\\x80\\x9d issues and try to address them.\\n\\n\\tHuang Jing, director of the Centre on Asia and Globalization at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore\\n\\n\\tThe Chinese and US people have never had irreconcilable confrontations. In the two world wars, especially WWII, they supported each other. Even during the Cold War, their desire to have friendly relations never perished.\\n\\n\\tSince Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s reform and opening-up, the US has been closely linked to China in economic, cultural and political spheres. Despite unavoidable conflicts over national interests, the two peoples donâ\\x80\\x99t want to become enemies. It is unimaginable that either side would like to see war breaking out between the two countries. Most people hope that the two countries can have exchanges, seek cooperation and develop a good relationship, which lays a foundation for building the new type of major power relationship.\\n\\n\\tIn political, economic and security exchanges, the two sides should work together toward institutionalization. After all, by building a new type of major power relationship, China and the US intend to avoid a zero-sum game and seek for win-win cooperation and compromise.\\n\\n\\tMost importantly, they intend to translate such a consensus into concrete policies and measures through institutionalizing the bilateral relationship so as to effectively manage the problems and difficulties between them.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n/2015/0916/c90000-8950970.html'}\n"

This relationship has become one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world.\\n\\n\\t\"We have conducted extensive exchanges and cooperation in nearly all areas including political, economic, educational, cultural, people-to-people and international affairs. History has proved that China and the US both gain from peaceful coexistence and cooperation, and lose from conflicts and confrontation,\" he said in the speech.\\n\\n\\tChina-US economic and trade relations is a critical pillar for our bilateral relations. It is mutually beneficial in nature. As the biggest developing country and the biggest developed country respectively, China and the US enjoy great complementarities in terms of natural and human resources, market, capital and technology.\\n\\n\\tIn 1979, the annual trade volume between our two countries was just 2.45 billion US dollars. Last year, the figure exceeded 590 billion US dollars, an increase of over 240 times in 36 years. Today, China and the US is each otherâ\\x80\\x99s 2nd largest trading partner, which brings tremendous benefits for the two peoples.\\n\\n\\tChina is the 3rd largest export market and the largest source of import for the US. More than 60,000 US enterprises have invested in China, including Apple, Intel, HP, Wal-Mart, McDonald\\'s and Starbucks and many others. Many Chinese households use Microsoft software, make calls on iPhones, drive General Motors cars and watch Hollywood movies. At the same time, Chinese companiesâ\\x80\\x99 investment in the US also witnessed remarkable increase.\\n\\n\\tDeepening economic ties have boosted the growth of countries, creating more jobs and bringing tangible benefits to the people of both nations. China and the US are now working on Bilateral Investment Treaty negotiations, which once realized, will further deepen the economic and trade cooperation.\\n\\n\\tSince China and the US resumed contact 36 years ago, the two sides have seen frequent high-level visits and improving dialogue mechanisms. Today, there are over 100 dialogue and cooperation mechanisms between the two countries. The most well-known ones are the Strategic and Economic Dialogues, the High-Level Consultation on People-to-People Exchanges, the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade.\\n\\n\\tThe bilateral sub-national relations also grow fast. Up till now, there are 41 pairs of sister province/state and 201 pairs of sister city between China and the US. For example, California is the sister state of Guangdong Province. San Francisco is the sister city of Shanghai.\\n\\n\\tIn 1979, only a few thousand Chinese and Americans visited each otherâ\\x80\\x99s country. Last year saw the figure increased to 4.3 million, which means each and every day, more than 15,000 people are flying over the Pacific Ocean. Every 17 minutes, there is a flight taking off or landing between our two countries.\\n\\n\\tBoth sides also launched a series of initiatives in the fields of education, science and technology, culture, sports, women and youth exchanges. In December 1978, 52 Chinese were first sent to study in the US. In February 1979, 8 Americans set forth on a journey to study in China. Last year, 275,000 Chinese students studied in the US while 24,000 Americans studied in China. Last year, 75 Chinese universities hosted approximately 12,000 American scholars, and 217 symposiums were held jointly by China and the US.\\n\\n\\tChina has pledged \"Three Ten-thousand Programs\", that is, to provide scholarships for 10,000 US students to study in Chinese universities, to sponsor 10,000 scholarships under the â\\x80\\x9cChinese Bridgeâ\\x80\\x9d program, and to send 10,000 Chinese to pursue doctorate degrees in the US. The US has also launched the \"One Hundred Thousand Strong Initiatives\" to send 100,000 US students to study in China.\\n\\n\\tThe growth of people-to-people exchanges between our two countries is unprecedented in history.\\n\\n\\tChina and the US maintain close and effective communication and coordination on major regional and international issues, including the Korean Peninsula, Iranian nuclear, Afghanistan, counterterrorism, energy security, public health and climate change.\\n\\n\\tThrough close coordination in fighting various challenges, China and the US are tremendously contributing to regional and global peace, stability and prosperity.\\n\\n\\tSince its economic reform and opening-up policy, China has step by step transformed from an isolated poor country into a new engine of the world economy. After 3 decades of high-speed growth, Chinese economy enters a state of New Normal. The gear of growth is shifting from high speed to medium-to-high speed, and China\\'s focus of development is more on quality instead of quantity. He said \"We will let the market play a decisive role in resource allocation. China stock market drop reflects the adjustment of China\\'s economy. The so-called \\'China economy collapse\\' is entirely groundless.\"\\n\\n\\tThis year marks the 70th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the founding of the United Nations.

The wrong moves of Abeâ\\x80\\x99s administration are criticized by an increasing number of Japanese people, including young Japanese, who used to show little concern about politics. Even young Japanese mothers bring their children to take part in activities to object to security-related bills.\\n\\n\\tLatest polls here showed that the majority of Japanese people opposed the security bills. The disapproval rating of Abeâ\\x80\\x99s cabinet exceeded his supporting rate. Itâ\\x80\\x99s necessary for Abe to respect the wishes of Japanese people. I will set myself against Abeâ\\x80\\x99s abuse of power, and I will do whatever I can to prevent the passage of security bills.\\n\\n\\tChina loves peace and will never seek hegemony. Thanks to a peaceful environment after World War II, the country has risen to become the worldâ\\x80\\x99s second largest economy. So it treasures peace more than any other country, and it will never wage wars. China will hold a parade on September 3, 2015, to mark the 70th anniversary of the victory of the War of the Chinese People\\'s Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. I will attend the activity as long as I am in good health.\\n\\n\\tJapan and China have similar languages and living environments. In some sense, Japanese culture developed in the exchanges between the two countries. The relations between two countries are inseparable. Japanâ\\x80\\x99s trade is increasingly dependent on China, but Japan has its advantages in science and technology development. The two countries should learn from each other, and strengthen exchanges. I deeply believe that itâ\\x80\\x99s an irrevocable trend for Japan to conduct friendly exchanges with China.\\n\\n\\tThe author is 91-year-old Former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tThis article was edited and translated from ã\\x80\\x8aé\\x9c\\x80è¦\\x81å\\x88\\x87å®\\x9eç»§æ\\x89¿â\\x80\\x9cæ\\x9d\\x91å±±è°\\x88è¯\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9dï¼\\x88å\\x9b½é\\x99\\x85è®ºå\\x9d\\x9bã\\x80\\x8b,source:People\\'s Daily', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n/2015/0812/c90000-8934828.html'}\n",

The document also serves as identification during a Taiwan residents\\' stay on the mainland.\\n\\n\\tThe plan to offer the permit-free policy was announced as Yu promised to create better conditions for cross-Straits exchanges.\\n\\n\\t\"We\\'ll continue to expand people-to-people exchanges across the Strait and engage more Taiwan compatriots in the trend of cross-Strait interaction,\" Yu said.\\n\\n\\tEASIER ACCESS\\n\\n\\tAttendees of the Straits Forum said the permit-free policy would make it much easier for Taiwan residents to visit the mainland, good news for booming cross-Strait tourism, business and grassroots exchanges.\\n\\n\\tTaiwan and the mainland broke off communication in 1949, after the Kuomintang (KMT) lost a civil war with the Communist Party of China and fled to the island.\\n\\n\\tCross-Strait exchanges and travels only became widely possible after 2008, when the KMT adopted mainland-friendly policies and the two sides opened direct mail, transport and trade links.\\n\\n\\tAs another breakthrough of cross-Strait ties, the Chinese mainland began to allow residents in certain cities to visit Taiwan as individual tourists in 2011 in a friendly bid to boost Taiwan\\'s tourism. So far, residents in 47 cities have been given such permits.\\n\\n\\tOfficial statistics show in 2014, Taiwan residents made 5.37 million visits to the mainland, up from 4.36 million in 2008.

A poll conducted by Taiwan-based TVBS earlier this year indicated about one third of Taiwan residents aged between 20 and 29 are interested in working on the mainland.\\n\\n\\tTACKLING MISUNDERSTANDINGS\\n\\n\\tThe plan to drop the entry permit requirement also demonstrates Chinese leaders\\' continued focus on people-to-people exchanges across the Strait.\\n\\n\\tAt the opening ceremony of the forum, Yu acknowledged problems in current cross-Strait communication, noting the island\\'s \"separatist force\" is still the biggest obstacle for peaceful development of the cross-Strait relations.\\n\\n\\t\"We\\'ll consistently support exchanges among compatriots of the two sides and firmly oppose the separatist forces\\' obstructive intent to the peaceful development of the relations,\" he said.\\n\\n\\t\"It\\'s common that people across the Strait have different perceptions over some issues, given different historical experiences they have encountered, and different social and political systems they live with. It\\'s understandable that some Taiwan compatriots still harbor misgivings on the development of the cross-Strait relations,\" he said.\\n\\n\\tIt is the existing differences that highlighted the necessity of exchanges across the Strait, the leader added.\\n\\n\\tIn March 2014, Taiwanese students seized the headquarters of the island\\'s legislative body in protest against what they saw as the undemocratic methods KMT employed to push a mainland-Taiwan service trade pact and its negative impact on Taiwan\\'s economy and society.\\n\\n\\tThe protest prompted concerns over the misunderstanding against the mainland among the Taiwan public, highlighting the need for deepening cross-Strait exchanges.\\n\\n\\tXi Jinping, while meeting KMT chairman Eric Chu in the capacity of the general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee in May, stressed \"people-to-people exchanges\" and \"heart-to-heart communication\" across the Strait.\\n\\n\\tHe called for respecting disparities, deepening mutual understanding and enhancing cultural and national identification.\\n\\n\\tIn Sunday\\'s speech, Yu encouraged more grassroots exchanges and friendship-building by young people on both sides, who he described as possessing \"boundless creativity.\"\\n\\n\\tHau Lung-pin, vice chairman of Taiwan\\'s ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party, who attended the event, agreed by saying that only interaction between ordinary people can secure a peaceful and stable cross-Strait development.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x904ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n/2015/0615/c90882-8906675.html'}\n"

The Asian giant is now Africa\\'s largest trading partner, and has contributed one fifth of the continent\\'s economic growth, according to the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\n\\tFor the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China is not only its largest trading partner but also the largest importer of its products, and the two sides are looking to upgrade their free trade deal this year.\\n\\n\\tIn the new era, the Chinese president proposed in his Wednesday speech, Asian and African nations should continue to be good friends, good partners and good brothers that always stands together in weal and woe and in thick and thin.\\n\\n\\tCOMMON PURSUIT OF DEVELOPMENT\\n\\n\\tSetting off from the heart of Zambia\\'s copper belt in Kapiri Mposhi, locomotives rumbled east along a 1,860-km railway to the port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.\\n\\n\\tIt is through this transnational railway, popularly known as the TAZARA and distinguished as one of China\\'s biggest aid projects in the 1970s, that landlocked Zambia finds its way out to the Indian Ocean.\\n\\n\\tThe rail link serves as a typical case of China\\'s decades-long support for Africa\\'s development, and a telling example of the increasingly strong economic dimension of the ever closer cooperation between the two dynamic continents.\\n\\n\\tWith the days of global colonialism and the Cold War long gone, the focus of Asia-Africa cooperation has shifted from political aspirations to economic ambitions, but the Bandung Spirit remains relevant.\\n\\n\\tAs disparity between the rich and the poor remains gaping, noted Professor Yang Baoyun, a well-known scholar with Thammasat University of Thailand, it is important for Asian and African countries to reinvigorate the Bandung Spirit and unite in their new common struggle, this time for economic prosperity.\\n\\n\\tThe two continents have already become robust powerhouses for global growth, and their combined economic output reached 29 trillion U.S. dollars last year, accounting for 37.5 percent of the world\\'s total and equaling 47 times the 1970 volume.\\n\\n\\tGiven that they make up nearly half of the world\\'s landmass and 70 percent of the population and their economies are highly complementary, their cooperation has enormous potential yet to be explored.\\n\\n\\tHowever, the way forward is fraught with pitfalls and hurdles. While some are faced with the so-called middle-income trap, some others are still exploring their own development paths.\\n\\n\\tAsian and African countries, Xi suggested, need to boost win-win cooperation and create the \"one plus one greater than two\" effect, by aligning their development strategies and translating their economic complementarity into a driving force for common growth.\\n\\n\\tIn addition, the Chinese president called for closer South-South and South-North cooperation, and urged the developed countries to honor their aid pledges for their developing peers and offer more assistance with no political strings attached.\\n\\n\\tXi\\'s Wednesday speech, particularly his proposal, opened up a new chapter in Asia-Africa interaction, as the content and prospect of the cross-continental cooperation has become ever richer and brighter, said Tang Zhimin, director of China-ASEAN Studies under the Bangkok-based Panyapiwat Institute of Management.\\n\\n\\tSTAUNCH CHAMPION OF ASIA-AFRICA COOPERATION\\n\\n\\tChina has for long played a constructive and exemplary role in Asia-Africa cooperation, bringing out new visions and practical initiatives for the two continents to prosper side by side.\\n\\n\\t\"China is an active champion and driver of Asia-Africa unity and cooperation. ... Under the new circumstances, China will continue to unswervingly promote Asia-Africa cooperation,\" Xi told the leaders and dignitaries from about 100 nations at the Jakarta summit.\\n\\n\\tDuring his visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia in 2013, Xi put forward the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiatives, in a bid to rejuvenate win-win cooperation among nations along the ancient trade routes.\\n\\n\\tThanks to the two comprehensive projects, Silk Road countries will be able to take a ride on the express train of China\\'s economic growth, said Asanga Abeyagoonasekera, executive director of Sri Lanka\\'s Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute for International Relations and Strategic Studies.\\n\\n\\tThe Belt and Road initiatives, echoed former Pakistani Foreign Secretary Akram Zakisaid, are aimed not just at a revival of the historical Silk Road, but also at achieving co-prosperity in a peaceful way.\\n\\n\\tMeanwhile, the China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), dedicated to improving regional infrastructure, is expected to start operation by the end of this year.\\n\\n\\tThe enthusiasm that prompted 57 countries, including many from outside Asia, to join the AIIB as founding members is an eloquent testament to the all-win nature of the initiative.\\n\\n\\tChina, Xi reaffirmed in Jakarta, stands ready to work with interested nations to realize the Belt and Road vision, build the AIIB into a high-quality and all-win institution and achieve common development and prosperity.\\n\\n\\tAlso at the summit, Xi announced that China will, among other programs, provide 100,000 training opportunities for Asian and African developing nations in the coming five years and set up a China-Asia-Africa cooperation center.\\n\\n\\tSamuel Stevquoah, chief of staff at the office of Liberia\\'s vice president, said he highly appreciates China\\'s provision of training opportunities for developing countries.\\n\\n\\t\"This is very important for us.

The Asian giant is now Africa\\'s largest trading partner, and has contributed one fifth of the continent\\'s economic growth, according to the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\n\\tFor the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China is not only its largest trading partner but also the largest importer of its products, and the two sides are looking to upgrade their free trade deal this year.\\n\\n\\tIn the new era, the Chinese president proposed in his Wednesday speech, Asian and African nations should continue to be good friends, good partners and good brothers that always stands together in weal and woe and in thick and thin.\\n\\n\\tCOMMON PURSUIT OF DEVELOPMENT\\n\\n\\tSetting off from the heart of Zambia\\'s copper belt in Kapiri Mposhi, locomotives rumbled east along a 1,860-km railway to the port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.\\n\\n\\tIt is through this transnational railway, popularly known as the TAZARA and distinguished as one of China\\'s biggest aid projects in the 1970s, that landlocked Zambia finds its way out to the Indian Ocean.\\n\\n\\tThe rail link serves as a typical case of China\\'s decades-long support for Africa\\'s development, and a telling example of the increasingly strong economic dimension of the ever closer cooperation between the two dynamic continents.\\n\\n\\tWith the days of global colonialism and the Cold War long gone, the focus of Asia-Africa cooperation has shifted from political aspirations to economic ambitions, but the Bandung Spirit remains relevant.\\n\\n\\tAs disparity between the rich and the poor remains gaping, noted Professor Yang Baoyun, a well-known scholar with Thammasat University of Thailand, it is important for Asian and African countries to reinvigorate the Bandung Spirit and unite in their new common struggle, this time for economic prosperity.\\n\\n\\tThe two continents have already become robust powerhouses for global growth, and their combined economic output reached 29 trillion U.S. dollars last year, accounting for 37.5 percent of the world\\'s total and equaling 47 times the 1970 volume.\\n\\n\\tGiven that they make up nearly half of the world\\'s landmass and 70 percent of the population and their economies are highly complementary, their cooperation has enormous potential yet to be explored.\\n\\n\\tHowever, the way forward is fraught with pitfalls and hurdles. While some are faced with the so-called middle-income trap, some others are still exploring their own development paths.\\n\\n\\tAsian and African countries, Xi suggested, need to boost win-win cooperation and create the \"one plus one greater than two\" effect, by aligning their development strategies and translating their economic complementarity into a driving force for common growth.\\n\\n\\tIn addition, the Chinese president called for closer South-South and South-North cooperation, and urged the developed countries to honor their aid pledges for their developing peers and offer more assistance with no political strings attached.\\n\\n\\tXi\\'s Wednesday speech, particularly his proposal, opened up a new chapter in Asia-Africa interaction, as the content and prospect of the cross-continental cooperation has become ever richer and brighter, said Tang Zhimin, director of China-ASEAN Studies under the Bangkok-based Panyapiwat Institute of Management.\\n\\n\\tSTAUNCH CHAMPION OF ASIA-AFRICA COOPERATION\\n\\n\\tChina has for long played a constructive and exemplary role in Asia-Africa cooperation, bringing out new visions and practical initiatives for the two continents to prosper side by side.\\n\\n\\t\"China is an active champion and driver of Asia-Africa unity and cooperation. ... Under the new circumstances, China will continue to unswervingly promote Asia-Africa cooperation,\" Xi told the leaders and dignitaries from about 100 nations at the Jakarta summit.\\n\\n\\tDuring his visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia in 2013, Xi put forward the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiatives, in a bid to rejuvenate win-win cooperation among nations along the ancient trade routes.\\n\\n\\tThanks to the two comprehensive projects, Silk Road countries will be able to take a ride on the express train of China\\'s economic growth, said Asanga Abeyagoonasekera, executive director of Sri Lanka\\'s Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute for International Relations and Strategic Studies.\\n\\n\\tThe Belt and Road initiatives, echoed former Pakistani Foreign Secretary Akram Zakisaid, are aimed not just at a revival of the historical Silk Road, but also at achieving co-prosperity in a peaceful way.\\n\\n\\tMeanwhile, the China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), dedicated to improving regional infrastructure, is expected to start operation by the end of this year.\\n\\n\\tThe enthusiasm that prompted 57 countries, including many from outside Asia, to join the AIIB as founding members is an eloquent testament to the all-win nature of the initiative.\\n\\n\\tChina, Xi reaffirmed in Jakarta, stands ready to work with interested nations to realize the Belt and Road vision, build the AIIB into a high-quality and all-win institution and achieve common development and prosperity.\\n\\n\\tAlso at the summit, Xi announced that China will, among other programs, provide 100,000 training opportunities for Asian and African developing nations in the coming five years and set up a China-Asia-Africa cooperation center.\\n\\n\\tSamuel Stevquoah, chief of staff at the office of Liberia\\'s vice president, said he highly appreciates China\\'s provision of training opportunities for developing countries.\\n\\n\\t\"This is very important for us.

      "1091,{'發稿日': ['April16', '2015'], '新聞標題': 'Transcript of Premier Li Keqiangâ\\x80\\x99s Interview with Financial Times Editor Lionel Barber', '作者': 'Xinhua', '新聞內文': 'On the afternoon of 31 March 2015, Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council gave an exclusive interview to Lionel Barber, Editor of the Financial Times, at the Great Hall of the People. The transcript is as follows:\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: Good to see you again, Mr. Barber. I recall that last year we met at a time when there were new developments in global economic recovery. And now we are still witnessing new dynamics in the global economy. Our meeting today also shows that China is ready for even closer interaction with the global economy, in which it has already become deeply integrated. And China is ready to continue to make its contribution to facilitating the global economic recovery. The correspondent you sent to China speaks Chinese so well that if I do not see him in person, I hardly know that he is a foreigner.\\n\\n\\tBarber: Premier Li, itâ\\x80\\x99s very good to be back in Beijing, resuming our strategic dialogue. I recall in our last conversation, we talked about the risks in the world economy. And we know that the central banks in America, Europe, Britain and Japan are engaged in unconventional monetary policy to maintain economic growth. But in our last conversation, you asked me whether I believe there were risks when this period of unconventional policy ends. And I said I thought they were manageable. Do you share that view as the US prepares to end its quantitative easing?\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: I have to say I am half convinced and half doubtful. When the QE is in place, there may be all sorts of players managing to stay afloat in this big ocean. Yet it is difficult to predict now what may come out of it when the QE is withdrawn. And although there is little debate about whether there will be an interest hike in the United States, people are quite uncertain about when this interest hike will take place. Honestly speaking, it is quite easy for one to introduce QE policy, as it is little more than printing money. But what about the structural problems that have led to the global financial crisis and weak economic recovery? We believe one needs to undertake structural reforms. Yet not that many countries have taken significant steps in this direction. This is like treating a patient. We need to give him IV drip and antibiotics. Otherwise, it may cost us the time to cure his disease. But eventually, one has to discontinue the use of antibiotics to allow the patient himself to recover on his own physical strength. So Iâ\\x80\\x99m not an outright opposer to QE, but I believe what is more important is the structural reforms.\\n\\n\\tBarber: Premier Li, I just come from Tokyo where I spent nine days in Japan looking closely at their economic experiment. I met with Prime Minister Abe for an hour for an interview. I wonder, are you concerned that the depreciation of the yen and the euro against the RMB means China is less competitive and you may have to devalue in response?\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: China has been advancing the reform of the RMB exchange rate formation mechanism to widen the RMB floating band and improve the market-based, managed exchange rate regime. For some time, there has been slight devaluation of the Chinese currency. But this is not because of the steps taken by the Chinese side, but because of a stronger US dollar. I believe the current value of the RMB is basically stable. We donâ\\x80\\x99t want to see further devaluation of the Chinese currency, because we canâ\\x80\\x99t rely on devaluing our own currency to boost export. Instead, what we need is to boost our domestic demand. Otherwise, it will be difficult for us to adjust our economic structure. We donâ\\x80\\x99t think companies in China should mainly rely on a devalued Chinese currency to boost export. Instead, they should focus on enhancing their competitiveness by raising the quality of products and making technological innovations. At the same time, we hope that all major economies will enhance coordination on macroeconomic policies. We donâ\\x80\\x99t want to see a scenario in which major economies trip over each other to devalue their currencies. That will lead to a currency war. And if China feels compelled to devalue the RMB in this process, we donâ\\x80\\x99t think this will be something good for the international financial system. This may ultimately lead to trade protectionism and impede the globalization process. This is something we donâ\\x80\\x99t want to see.\\n\\n\\tBarber: Premier Li, may I share with you one clear impression from my visit to Japan regarding Japan-China relations. The message from the highest level with whom I conducted many interviews was that China-Japan relations have improved. There is reference to the meeting between President Xi and Prime Minister Abe. And I wonder whether you think there is improvement, do you agree with that? And whether this is durable or just a pause. And there may be problems ahead, for example around the 70th anniversary and World War II statement that the Japanese government is planning to make.\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: The current China-Japan relationship is still in a quite difficult spot. There is wish from both sides for improved relations. But such improvement needs a foundation. The crux of the issue is how to view the history of the Second World War, and whether one can draw lessons from that part of history to ensure that the war will never repeat itself. I suppose when you were in Japan, you may have heard such views that the war took place 70 years ago, and the war was something done by the past generation and has little to do with the current generation of the Japanese people. Why does the Chinese side refuse to let it go? I donâ\\x80\\x99t think this is something about the Chinese refusing to let that part of history go. What we believe is history should not be forgotten. Mankind has successfully kept a large world war at bay in the past 70 years. We believe it is because lessons have been drawn from that part of history in which mankind acted stupidly. It is common knowledge in political science that leaders of a country, while inheriting the achievements made by their predecessors, should also shoulder the responsibilities for crimes committed by past generations. This is how one establishes his true sense of national identity and responsibility.\\n\\n\\tThis year marks the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese peopleâ\\x80\\x99s war of resistance against Japanese aggression and the world anti-Fascist war. Many countries in the world are considering holding activities to mark this important moment. As I said at my press conference a few weeks ago, this is both a test and an opportunity to China-Japan relations. History, if not forgotten, can serve as a guide for the future. That will give us the opportunity for improving China-Japan relations. Just now I mentioned the â\\x80\\x9cstupid warâ\\x80\\x9d. What I mean is the stupid war of aggression waged by those militarists. We have the highest respect for all anti-Fascist fighters.\\n\\n\\tBarber: Could I turn to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank? Are you very pleased that the British have now started a stampede to join the bank?\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: The original consideration for putting forward the AIIB initiative is there is a large funding shortfall for infrastructure development in Asia, especially connectivity building. This shortfall needs to be met with the support of several multilateral financing institutions. The AIIB is going to be an open and transparent institution. It welcomes the participation of countries from outside the Asian region. And we welcome British application for joining the bank. China and the UK should continue to work together to develop a partnership for growth. I wish to emphasize that the AIIB and ADB can work in parallel in promoting Asian development. And the initiative of AIIB is not to reinvent the wheel. Rather it is intended to be a supplement to the current international financial system. China wants to work with others to uphold the existing international financial system. And we are ready to continue to play our role in building the current international financial system. And if there is a need for reforming the current system, we are also ready to work with other countries to help make the system more just, reasonable and balanced.\\n\\n\\tBarber: So Premier, you donâ\\x80\\x99t share the view that I sometimes hear in China that we did not build the liberal post-war financial system, so therefore we have to create a new order. You are saying to me this is complementary, not a challenge, to the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank.\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: Let me first emphasize China was deeply involved in establishing the post-war international order from the very outset. China was a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a founding member of this world body. Although afterwards for some years China closed its door to the outside world, since the day it reopened the door, China has been playing its due role in the international economic and financial systems. At the same time, the current international economic and financial systems have opened up broad dimensions for Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s development. For example, we gained advanced experience from working with the World Bank and other institutions, and our WTO membership has also helped Chinese companies gain deeper knowledge about how they can compete with others under international rules. So China has been a beneficiary of the current international system in terms of both peace and development. Still China is a developing country, and we still have a long way to go before we can achieve modernization. We still need to draw upon the advanced technologies and managerial expertise of other countries. Past progress shows that pursuit of mutual benefit makes all winners. And that is in Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s fundamental interest. So there is no such thing as breaking the existing order.\\n\\n\\tBarber: Sure many will be delighted to hear your description of China as â\\x80\\x9chighly responsible stakeholderâ\\x80\\x9d. But do you have the same enlightened view of TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership?\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: We have an open attitude towards the TPP. China is actively working with others to advance the RCEP negotiation. We believe the RCEP, economic integration in the Asia-Pacific, the China-ASEAN FTA, the China-ROK FTA and so on can all work in parallel. This applies to the TPP too. But all in all, I believe we need to have both wheels in motion in advancing trade. That is: there can be bilateral and regional FTA arrangements with their respective distinctive features. At the same time, there also needs to be full compliance with the WTO rules to promote economic globalization and trade liberalization.\\n\\n\\tBarber: Let me turn to the Chinese economy where you are engaged in a historic transformation. If I ask you for your own report card, how many marks out of ten would you give yourself so far? Eight or nine?\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: It seems to be against the general rule for me to pass a score on how I have performed. I believe that it is up to the people to pass a judgment. As far as I am concerned, I will continue to do my best.\\n\\n\\tBarber: Are you concerned about inflation, particularly in the real estate market?\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: Inflation has been quite low in the past several months in China. The figure for January and February this year was no more than two percent. In January, it was just zero point something percent. Some even think there is deflation in China. I have already addressed such a question before. China is not in deflation, because over one third of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s CPI composition is food price, and we had a bumper harvest last year. But the tumble of international commodity prices did put our PPI under much pressure. So, in a certain sense, we are on the receiving end of deflation, but this does not mean there is deflation in China.\\n\\n\\tFor the real estate market, we will continue to take a multi-pronged approach to meet the diverse needs in light of the different conditions of different localities. We will continue to build more government-subsidized housing units. We want to have steady and sound growth of the real estate market. The government will continue to encourage the home-buying for self use or improved living conditions, and guard against property bubble. Honestly, there may be certain conflict of interests among these goals, and we need to strike a proper balance among multiple goals and exercise proper regulation. This is not going to be easy, but we will do our best and we believe we can do it.\\n\\n\\tBarber: Premier Li, the Chinese government has been engaged in a very intense anti-corruption campaign. And you have caught many flies and quite a few tigers recently. Will this campaign ever end?\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: Anti-corruption is a long-term task for any country. It is hard to say when the fight against corruption should start and when it should be brought to an end. Itâ\\x80\\x99s true that we are intensifying efforts in fighting corruption. In particular, we are very serious about institution building. The government is streamlining administration and delegating powers. We want to ensure that government power will be exercised with restraint, and the government will fully live up to its due responsibilities to boost market vitality, eliminate the space for rent seeking behaviors and uproot corruption. This will be a long-term struggle. If one is to translate â\\x80\\x9ccampaignâ\\x80\\x9d into Chinese, it should be â\\x80\\x9cè¡\\x8cå\\x8a¨â\\x80\\x9d instead of â\\x80\\x9cè¿\\x90å\\x8a¨â\\x80\\x9d (è¯\\x91è\\x80\\x85å\\x8a\\xa0: or movement).\\n\\n\\tBarber: But it is a very powerful campaign, because I spoke to a very prominent Western businessman who went to see one of the Chinese oil companies, and he said he didnâ\\x80\\x99t recognize anybody in the room, because the 30 people who were there last year had all disappeared.\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: Most Chinese companies are still functioning normally. We hope foreign companies wonâ\\x80\\x99t cut off their ties with Chinese companies.\\n\\n\\tBarber: Itâ\\x80\\x99s just the foreign companies are very impressed by the Chinese governmentâ\\x80\\x99s magic act, and they disappear. But seriously, Mr. Premier, there has been some talk of hostile western forces in the media. As a visitor who comes from the West, who counts himself as a friend of China, I just worry about that. Can you just give me some reassurances that this is just talk?\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: Since China started the reform and opening-up, an increasing number of foreign journalists have come to China. And now, over 60 countries have resident journalists in China and those journalists are welcome to work in China and favorable conditions will be provided for their work. I believe that there will only be more foreign correspondents coming to China. We hope that they will report to the world a China as it is. At the same time, foreign journalists need to abide by the laws and regulations in their host countries. Some foreigners may not have been to China and itâ\\x80\\x99s natural that they may not know China that well or even have some misunderstanding about this country. Truthful reports by the media can help dispel their doubts. I believe more and more foreigners will come to China and see that China is an open and inclusive country which hopes for mutual respect and mutual learning between people of different countries. As for hostile activities, there are violent, separatist and terrorist crimes committed in China, and they should be handled in accordance with law. There may be different punishments for drug-related offences in other countries, but the Chinese people have a painful memory about the harm of opium, hence we resolutely combat all drug-related crimes. And I hope we will have your understanding about this.\\n\\n\\tBarber: Mr. Premier, we are in the Hall of Hong Kong, are you satisfied that the package offered by the Beijing government will be adopted by the Hong Kong legislature? Or do you think we are still going to have problems, student unrest in Hong Kong? Are you worried about that?\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: About Hong Kong, you know that we always follow the principles of â\\x80\\x9cone country, two systemsâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cthe people of Hong Kong administering Hong Kongâ\\x80\\x9d and a high degree of autonomy. The Chinese central government will continue to support the Hong Kong SAR government and the Hong Kong SAR Chief Executive in administering the region in accordance with law. In spite of what happened recently in Hong Kong, we believe that past progress has shown that the principle of â\\x80\\x9cone country, two systemsâ\\x80\\x9d is the right way to take and that Hong Kong will maintain long-term stability and prosperity. The splendid night scene of Hong Kong in the picture behind us carries three key messages: the â\\x80\\x9cone country, two systemsâ\\x80\\x9d principle has strong vitality, the Hong Kong SAR government has full capability and the Hong Kong residents have their wisdom. We believe all issues can be properly settled.\\n\\n\\tBarber: Premier Li, thank you for your generous time for me as a visitor to Beijing. This conversation has merely whetted my appetite for the third conversation, maybe even on record, either in London or even in Beijing, or in Hong Kong.\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: I see you have recorded it. I can take responsibility for every sentence said. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve had a very good conversation and I see you do have the capacity to bombard me with a succession of questions. So, maybe one final question.\\n\\n\\tBarber: This is one newspaper, two journalists. I give this opportunity to Mr. Pilling.\\n\\n\\tPilling: Some of the actions being taken in China, Mr. Li, including exchange rates, reserve requirement, and in terms of housing market, suggest that you are worried that the economy is slowing down more quickly than you would like. And there is some data that shows that the economy is growing well below 7%. Are you worried that the economy is slowing down too fast?\\n\\n\\tLi Keqiang: I cannot give you the data of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s GDP growth in the first quarter now. In some time, it will be released by Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s statistical bureau in accordance with law and we will not intervene in those data. On the whole, there has been stability in employment. This is a very important thing, because the ultimate goal of steady growth is to ensure employment. Itâ\\x80\\x99s true that our economy is still under downward pressure. Hence, since the fourth quarter of last year, we have made fine-tuning adjustments to our fiscal and monetary policies, but these adjustments are not a QE policy. Instead, they are targeted regulatory steps and they have paid off. Our goal is to keep Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s economic operation within the proper range. We want to achieve not just an approximately 7% growth, but also fairly sufficient employment, increase in household income and improvement of the environment. These preemptive measures and fine-tuning adjustments to our fiscal and monetary policies as well as the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s self-targeted reform of scaling back administrative power to give more play to the role of the market have managed to offset the downward pressure on economic growth. We have the ability to keep economic operation within the proper range. The Chinese economy has become so large, amounting to 10 trillion US dollars. So, it wonâ\\x80\\x99t be easy to achieve another 7% growth this year. This requires vision, perseverance and courage. When the end of the year comes and we need to turn in the report card, we shall ask the people and you too, Mr. Barber, are also welcome to pass the score on how we have performed.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n/2015/0416/c90883-8878818.html'}\n"

Japan should grasp the opportunity to improve and promote bilateral ties and create good conditions to expand bilateral trade,\" Li said while meeting Yohei Kono, president of the Japanese Association for the Promotion of International Trade (JAPIT).\\n\\n\\tKono is leading a large delegation from Japan\\'s economic circles, including more than 60 Japanese entrepreneurs and politicians.\\n\\n\\tCiting the 70th anniversary of the victory in the World Anti-Fascist War and the Chinese People\\'s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression this year, Li said the bilateral relationship is facing a challenge and an opportunity, and the key is how Japan views and treats historical issues.\\n\\n\\tChina-Japan relations have soured since the Japanese government\\'s \"purchase\" of the Diaoyu Islands in September 2012. Territorial disputes,along with historical issues such as Japan\\'s textbook revisions, have hindered the development of bilateral ties.\\n\\n\\t\"Under current circumstances, we hope the Japanese side could take the long-term development of its relations with its neighbors into consideration, properly handle historical issues and send a positive signal that Japan will face up to history,\" Li said.\\n\\n\\tJapan invaded northeast China in September 1931, followed by a full-scale invasion that started on July 7, 1937. Around 35 million Chinese soldiers and civilians were killed or injured during the Japanese occupation, which continued until 1945.\\n\\n\\tKono, then chief cabinet secretary, made the \"Kono statement\" in 1993 acknowledging Japan\\'s recruitment of more than 200,000 young women from China, Korea and Southeast Asia who were forced to serve in military brothels during WWII.\\n\\n\\tFormer Japanese Prime Minister Murayama Tomiichi also made the \"Murayama Statement\" in 1995, which admitted Japan\\'s history of invasion and offered apologies.\\n\\n\\t\"Your statement showed the courage and accountability of a politician. Your statement and the \\'Murayama Statement\\' embodied the correct attitude that should be held by the Japanese government toward historical issues,\" Li said.\\n\\n\\tThough they face difficulties, the two countries still have willingness to improve ties. The Chinese government attaches importance to bilateral ties and is ready to continue to promote them on the basis of the four political documents and the spirit of reflecting on history and looking forward to the future. China will work with countries in the region to maintain East Asia\\'s peace, stability, development and prosperity, the premier noted.\\n\\n\\tThe four political documents refer to the China-Japan Joint Statement inked in 1972, the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1978, the China-Japan Joint Declaration of 1998 and a joint statement on advancing strategic and mutually beneficial relations that was signed in 2008.\\n\\n\\tKono said members of JAPIT are devoted to friendly cooperation between China and Japan. Japanese people were also victims of the war 70 years ago, and the pain and harm brought to Japan\\'s Asian neighbors should never be forgotten, he said.\\n\\n\\tHe said the China visit is based on the spirit of taking history as a mirror and looking forward to the future, and Japan wants to see improvement of bilateral ties.\\n\\n\\tKono also voiced the importance attached to China\\'s economic growth within Japan as well as the importance of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which was initiated by China.\\n\\n\\tKono and his delegation are visiting China from April 12 to 17. In addition to Beijing, they will visit Xi\\'an in northwest China\\'s Shaanxi Province.\\n\\n\\tJAPIT was established in 1954 to promote Japan\\'s foreign trade. The association began to specialize in economic and trade promotion with China in the 1960s and to promote non-governmental trade between the two countries, which laid a foundation for the normalization of bilateral ties. Kono, who was once Japan\\'s vice prime minister, foreign minister and speaker of the Japanese House of Representatives, is JAPIT\\'s 7th president.\\nã\\x80\\x901ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x902ã\\x80\\x91ã\\x80\\x903ã\\x80\\x91', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n/2015/0415/c90883-8878243.html'}\n",

      "1119,{'發稿日': ['March24', '2015'], '新聞標題': \"AIIB, China's Push for Asia-Pacific Economic Development\", '作者': 'CRI Online', '新聞內文': 'China\\'s Strategy\\n\\n\\tAs the second largest economy in the world, China has maintained a steady trade and development approach towards its regional neighbors. As a country with low per capita allocations of natural resources, China is dependent on its trade routes. For instance, the \"One Belt and One Road\" concept (OBOR) will diversify China\\'s ability to receive resources and shipped goods, while it connects China to markets with massive natural resources, accounting for 63 percent of the world\\'s population, a GDP of 2.1 trillion US dollars, but only 29 percent of the world\\'s output. Essentially, this is a golden opportunity for a country like China that needs natural resources to make products and markets to sell them in.\\n\\n\\tChina\\'s New Playbook\\n\\n\\tChina is in the midst of a massive retooling of its economy, as it seeks to avoid the \"Middle Income Trap\", which has stymied so many other emerging countries. The goals, as indicated by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at the NPC and CPPCC meetings, are to deleverage the inefficient excess capacity of China\\'s SOEs, make the finance and governance of its companies more market driven, accelerate the quality of its growth with more sustainable innovation and entrepreneurship, and clean up and streamline governance overall.\\n\\n\\tIn short, while China\\'s ultimate future will depend on its ability to compete with economies in Europe, North America and the rest of Asia, today it faces the process of managing the transition. Part of this involves utilizing the current production capability and assets which keep factories open and people working; another part involves strengthening the logistical and development infrastructure of its neighbors, so that they have a stable base to grow their economies and societies. This has been one of the main drivers pushing the series of international and regional infrastructure development initiatives introduced by China\\'s leadership. These include the BRICS Bank, the \"One Belt and One Road\" initiative, the expansion of the Shanghai Cooperation Agreement into infrastructure, numerous signed and negotiated bilateral and multilateral trade agreements and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).\\n\\n\\tHistorical Frustrations\\n\\n\\tThe other part of the story is the frustration China has felt at being left out of the financial decision making process at the traditional international funding institutions, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). All three institutions were legacies, in one way or another, of Bretton Woods, which created the foundations of the post-World War II financial system, which put the US and the Dollar in leading positions.\\n\\n\\tDespite recommendations from within the IMF and World Bank, the US has steadfastly stalled any reforms which would provide a larger role for China. The other part of this equation, which does not fit the Chinese international development model, is the inclusion of political and economic requirements, beyond the simple repayment of funds. As China\\'s policy emphasizes trade and development and non-interventionism, China tends to clash with the political and economic requirements that come with the loans from these institutions. The third issue is that these institutions have become very unwieldy, bureaucratic and politically dominated. The combination of these three factors has pushed China to think outside the box set up by Bretton Woods and look at developing financing mechanisms that fit China\\'s desire for more sustainable regional and international development.\\n\\n\\tNew Goals for a New Kind of Bank\\n\\n\\tThe goal of the AIIB is to provide infrastructure investment funds that help Asia-Pacific countries develop their internal and regional economies. In 2010 the ADB, which is dominated by Japan and the US, estimated that the Asia-Pacific region would need 8 trillion US dollars in infrastructure improvements before 2020. The ADB has less than 200 billion US dollars in total capital and is able to lend only about 10 billion a year. To address this need China has given an open invitation to all interested countries to become founding members of the 50-billion-dollar AIIB. To date 33 countries have voiced an interest. The actual articles of the AIIB have not been set up, but with less than a week and a half until the deadline to be included in the next planning phase, countries are scrambling to keep their options open.\\n\\n\\tThe greatest surprise to date has been the interest by European and southern Pacific countries and the open and cloaked opposition by the US, which has gone so far as to publicly scold Great Britain for indicating an interest. When France and Italy indicated a desire to be included, additional negative statements were issued by the Obama administration. In the background, the US has been lobbying South Korea, Japan and anyone who will listen about the dangers of such a bank.\\n\\n\\tUnfortunately, it comes at a time when the US is offering no substantial alternative alongside the unhappiness of a number of traditional EU allies with the US on the Ukraine and Middle East issues.\\n\\n\\tIdeological Opposition\\n\\n\\tThe opposition to the China-proposed AIIB comes mostly from the US and Japan who see any alternative structures to the Bretton Woods scheme as an erosion of their interests. Some of the countries cite the emphasis from the US, EU, Japanese and Australia on standards of governance, environmental and social safeguards and transparency.\\n\\n\\tBut in the end, the AIIB cannot and should not be a copy of the ADB, IMF or World Bank. These institutions have been in place for the last 70 years, but the world has moved on; it is time for institutions which reflect the needs and realities of today. It is highly probable that this means that loans will be based on need and ability to repay rather than political or economic ideology.\\n\\n\\tThe larger issues involved in the opposition to the AIIB are the result of distrust and cultural differences between the US and China. The distrust is based on the US\\'s concern about China\\'s growing political, economic and cultural influence, which Washington sees as a zero sum game. The cultural differences stem from the US view of American Exceptionalism, which assumes that only a country that accepts capitalism, democracy and Christianity can be legitimate and lasting. It is reflected in the US approach to Asia which emphasizes trade and security, as opposed to China\\'s trade and development. Unfortunately with a \"lame duck\" president and a hostile congress there is even less chance of reaching a mutual understanding on such an issue.\\n\\n\\tBenefits\\n\\n\\tTo continue their rapid development, the Asia-Pacific countries need major investment for all types of infrastructure. A lack of roads, railways, airports, ports, power stations, water works, sewers, hospitals and schools are among the biggest development barriers facing the region. In many cases these countries are heavily dependent on sales of raw resources, which put them at the mercy of boom and bust cycles of world demand. Their lack of ability to refine, process and manufacture their resources into goods keeps them at the low end of the value chain and thus the economic system. In addition, their financial infrastructure is weak and can be more easily affected by unstable money flows and currency fluctuations. Having numerous investment banks which emphasize different goals should be a desirable outcome for technologically robust developed economies looking for markets that can afford their products and services. But, until the US accepts this, it risks being increasingly isolated by other countries that see this as desirable.\\n\\n\\tOpportunities\\n\\n\\tFor countries that participate and companies who can get involved, this could usher in a new era of opportunities both short and long term. In the short term, while China has natural price advantages in certain industries, the breadth and scope of what is needed is well beyond anything China could provide by itself. In the long term, these types of investments will open reliable alternative production and sales markets which could further enhance the profitability of developed countries\\' supply chain economics. For the developing countries, it is a chance to climb the value ladder and develop stand-alone economies which can withstand global economic cycles. People should keep in mind that the rapid peaceful economic rise of China has already and will continue to create massive profits for companies and countries around the world.\\n\\n\\tFor China, the challenge is whether an increasingly isolated US becomes more intractable and less of a global player. With its massive resources, advanced technology and military power, the US is an essential partner in maintaining world order at a time when separatism and extremism has become rampant. The real issue is how China and the US can cooperate well in today\\'s multi-polar world.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/business/n/2015/0324/c90778-8867736.html'}\n"

      "1245,{'發稿日': ['May22', '2014'], '新聞標題': 'Summit to reshape Asian security with new concept', '作者': 'Xinhua', '新聞內文': 'SHANGHAI, May 21 \\xa0-- Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed on Wednesday a new concept of Asian security which analysts said bears significant implications for regional stability and the rebalancing of global security.\\n\\n\\tAddressing the fourth summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) held in Shanghai, Xi envisioned a mechanism that stresses common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security to tackle rising challenges facing the region with 67 percent of the world\\'s population and one third of the global economy.\\n\\n\\tIn sharp contrast to the decades-old security scheme based on Cold War mentality, the new concept addresses Asia\\'s unique challenges shaped by its historical grievances, current tensions and potential risks, said Qu Xing, head of the China Institute of International Studies.\\n\\n\\t\"We need to innovate our security concept, establish a new regional security cooperation architecture, and jointly build a shared and win-win road for Asian security,\" Xi said.\\n\\n\\tOne cannot live in the 21st century with the outdated thinking from the age of Cold War and zero-sum game, Xi said.\\n\\n\\tBy stressing sustainable security supported by sustainable development, the concept also provides a framework under which Asia can aspire to its revival based on economic prosperity, stability and cooperation, Qu said.\\n\\n\\tIn his proposal, Xi said Asia should oppose beefing up a military alliance targeted at a third party, and any attempt to dominate regional security affairs or infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries.\\n\\n\\tSecurity problems in Asia should eventually be solved by Asians themselves who are able to achieve regional peace and stability through cooperation, he said.\\n\\n\\tHe urged countries in the region to insist on resolving disputes through peaceful means and oppose the arbitrary use of force or threats.\\n\\n\\tProvocations and escalation of tensions for selfish interests should also be opposed, he added.\\n\\n\\tBesides traditional security threats, Asia has found it difficult to respond effectively to non-traditional security threats including terrorism, transnational crimes, environmental security, cyber security, energy and resource security and major natural disasters which are clearly on the rise.\\n\\n\\tTo build an Asian security mansion that could stand the test of wind storms, Xi said, \"we need to focus on development, actively improve people\\'s lives and narrow down the wealth gap to cement the foundation of security.\"\\n\\n\\t\"We need to advance the process of common development and regional integration, foster sound interactions and synchronized progress of regional economic cooperation and security cooperation, and promote sustainable security through sustainable development,\" the president added.\\n\\n\\tThe summit came six decades after the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence was put forward by Asian countries and adopted as a guide to international relations, said Li Weijian, a researcher with Shanghai Institute for International Studies.\\n\\n\\tAs an extension of the five principles, the new concept will not only provide significant guidance to promote peace and stability of Asia, but also add momentum to the rebalancing of the world\\'s economic and security dynamics, Li said.\\n\\n\\tSTRONGER CICA\\n\\n\\tThe summit was attended by leaders and representatives from 47 countries or international organizations, the largest scale in CICA\\'s 22-year history.\\n\\n\\tHuang Renwei, deputy dean of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said the summit reached wide and concrete consensus instead of empty talks.\\n\\n\\tProposed solutions to the region\\'s most pressing issues have high feasibility, and, if implemented well, could drive the forum to an architecture with higher level, he said.\\n\\n\\tCalling the CICA the largest and most representative regional security forum with the largest number of participants, Xi proposed to make the forum a security dialogue and cooperation platform that covers the whole of Asia.\\n\\n\\tHe called for enhancing the capacity and institutional building of the CICA, improving functions of the CICA Secretariat, and establishing a mechanism within the forum for defense consultations among member states.\\n\\n\\tXi expected closer regional exchanges and cooperation in anti-terrorism, business, tourism, environmental protection, culture and people-to-people exchanges.\\n\\n\\tThe Chinese president proposed to put in place a non-governmental exchange network for CICA parties through holding CICA non-governmental forums and other means, to increase the conference\\'s influence and promote regional security governance.\\n\\n\\tHe also suggested strengthening the inclusiveness and openness of the CICA, and step up cooperation with other organizations in the region and expand dialogue and communication with other regions.\\n\\n\\tXi\\'s comments were echoed by Russian President Vladmir Putin who called the CICA an effective mechanism to drive security cooperation in Asia.\\n\\n\\tIt is highly expected that as China has taken over the CICA presidency for 2014 to 2016, the forum would further promote peace and cooperation as a balanced, equal and coordinated security construct that takes into consideration each country\\'s interests and concerns, he said.\\n\\n\\tKazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev said expanding economic cooperation should top CICA\\'s agenda.\\n\\n\\tHe believes the Silk Road economic belt envisioned by Xi could boost infrastructure development, laying a sound foundation for security cooperation among nations along the route that overlaps with the ancient trade itinerary connecting the East and the West.', '網址': 'http://english.people.com.cn/n/2014/0522/c90883-8730794.html'}\n"
